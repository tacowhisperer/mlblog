I made an exception to this personal policy with a large order from the store's biggest customer. My guess from the conversation between Boss Man and Middle Man (the guy that acts as a middleman between this store and the taqueria that orders from the store), the location where they get their drinks and other things is currently closed, so today's order was double the size it normally is. For context, every Sunday, this taqueria orders 15 boxes of 30lb tripe, and then whatever other miscellaneous things like cheese, meats, cups, napkins, soaps, etc., and usually we end up hitting just shy of the 450lb mark of goods. This morning though, we very easily hit the 600+lb with the extra Mexican drinks and other heavy items that they ordered through the phone.</p>\n<p>So the reason I bring all of this up is because on Sundays, I'm the one that tackles this order and gets everything non-meat in a cart, and during checkout, whoever loads the items onto Middle Man's truck gets a $5-$10 tip. Last week, the order was unusually large, so I ended up heaving and ho-ing all kinds of boxes into the cart, and then KnuckleHead Man, the coworker that takes care of this order from Monday through Saturday, loaded everything into the truck. What would have been fair is for KnuckleHead Man to have shared the tip, just like I shared my tip with Chief.com some weeks ago. Instead, he took all the tip to himself, and went on to do whatever else he does on Sundays. I obviously wasn't happy about it, but I wasn't going to make a big deal about it since, thankfully, I have plenty of hours to work during the week and I get paid enough to overcome my debts and still have some leftover to save for critical life expenses. So, whatever. Boss Man noticed that KnuckleHead Man didn't share the tip, and even said that that was bs and I should go fight for some. I let him know it's fine, and just left it at that.</p>\n<p>But today's eeeextra large order was very much a two man task, and when Boss Man saw everything that was going to be loaded, he just started laughing his ass off. He said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>God damn, KnuckleHead Man….</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he couldn't finish his words from how much he was laughing. I started laughing too because this man was going to be out there sweating like a pig in this hot, humid, sunny Texas morning for his precious tip that I generously and happily let him have all to himself 😂😂😂 The big moment to load everything up came, and sure enough, KnuckleHead Man wasn't going to be missing out on his cut. </p>\n<p>But the look on his face when he saw everything was priceless. Boss Man and I started laughing, and when everything was done and Middle Man left, KnuckleHead Man came up to me and said</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>You should have helped me man, look at all the f*cken sweat I'm covered in!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>🤣🤣🤣 That was well worth the tip I missed this week.</p>"},{"date":"7/11/2020 16:40:09","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Saturday morning??

I don't know if it's because I'm paying more attention or I'm starting to get involved in some sort of love pentagram over here, but I got hit with not one but <strong>two</strong> different love handles this morning. So juicy bit coming in, either a coworker's got a mad crush on another coworker and is feeling fired up about asking, orrrrrr based on a really weirdly tender hug I saw the two sharing about a week ago, might be involved in something forbiddingly 🌶🔥🌶🔥🌶🔥🌶 The way I found out is the dude told me</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I'll leave you in charge of &lt;female coworker&gt; that you take care of her</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>lol what the f*ck?</p>\n<p>Like, it was weird that he said it, and it was weirder that he kept repeating it, so there's that! Imma let that one brew for longer before dropping more goodies if anything else drops from that, so stay tuned 🤐</p>\n<p>On the second front, Female Me came at me today with some intense questioning about my opinion as a man. For starters, I'm humbled that anyone older than me would want that kind of opinion. But actually though, I'm more surprised that these conversation topics aren't left behind in high school age lol We all really are children that get stuck in ever-aging and eventually decaying bodies.</p>\n<p>So Female Me wants my opinion on the behaviors of a man that she (or someone she knows, I couldn't really understand her that well through the mask, fans, music, etc.) speaks to. Apparently, the guy seems to be interested at first, but then later acts aloof or stops responding or calling altogether. I actually suspect that the guy might either have commitment issues, or he has more than one woman, but what I ended up telling her was that I can't make that kind of a judgment without knowing more details other than calling habits 🤷‍♀️</p>\n<p>Wow, adults are weird objects!</p>\n<p>Grape Man's over once more! He's stopped getting the 4K brand cigarettes and started working on the other \"inferior\" 99¢ cigarettes.

I was trying to calculate how much money is to be made by buying a box of masks from Home Depot and selling them for $1 behind the Men's back. Turns out, if you can invest 100% of your money in this, there's a 31.9% profit for you to make by selling face masks obtained at that $34.99+tax price, so go figure 😋</p>\n<p>The Men finally declared the need for a new cashier, so it looks like we're going to be looking at some interesting couple of weeks ahead. I call dibs on teaching the new cashier(s) the tips and tricks for success at this store -- literally don't fuck up and you're golden 😂😂 My bet is that, assuming we get someone completely new to the game, we're going to end up going through a couple of people as they come to realize the heavy hand of the Men.

It's not uncommon for me to talk to many people where the general life happenings around us are getting extremely tiresome and it shows with how everyone interacts. Life is currently, undoubtedly, a giant chore from the moment you walk out the door to the moment you're safely back home ready (or not) for another day. Today, Militant Man, in the midst of everything that needs to get done in the store and in between the wakes of people coming in for their daily bread, showed some cracks as well. He tries his best to remain safe given all the different people he has to deal with on the daily, and he feels that despite wearing 3 face masks and washing his hands constantly, it's not enough to feel like he can keep this thing at bay. And it's true, one can only do so much, and unfortunately, we rely on the cooperation of everyone, including the Karens, dum dums, Princess Brothers, and you name 'em.</p>\n<p>But boring non-news aside; it turns out that the damn things are real LMAOOO</p>\n<div class=\"video_wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bQlpDiXPZHQ?playsinline=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This not-even-that-old-looking woman was proudly walking around the store with one of those today, lights flashing and all.

Today I heard a super rare event, a shy coworker singing to a Shakira song, albeit super quietly and in her own little corner, but it happened!</p>\n<p>Feelsgoodman</p>\n<p>Finally, I don't want to say that I'm famous, because I'm not. But this one lady walked up to my register, and so I started charging her items like I have everyone else. Then she makes a very curious question…… She asks me if I \"went to <strong>&lt;this one specific high school&gt;</strong>?\" I was immediately intrigued on how she knows (ignore the shirts that I wear from there all the time lmao), so I said \"Yeah, I did.\" Then she came at me directly with something that I never, and I mean <strong><em>never</em></strong>, expected to hear from a rando</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yeah, I recognized you from an interview you did on <strong>&lt;local news channel&gt;</strong>.

She said her two kids went there, and one graduated this year and is going to start university this coming school year in engineering.</p>\n<p>But yeah, what they say is true.

It starts out as a dark husk of a building whose only life are the ever-turning ceiling fans over the produce and maybe the occasional hobo sleeping in the cart corral. The doors are unlocked, the theft alarm is deactivated, and the line of workers waiting in the darkness outside hunkers in and rushes to the clock to punch in as fast as possible. Then, like a clockwork, you see the lights get turned on, the carts placed outside, avocados get processed, burners turned on, and finally, you get the cumbias from the lovely taqueria ladies playing in the background. That's when you know this is a new day, and it's time to put your game face on once more whether you want to or not. And then you start the day, and all is going as well as it can given the number of tasks needed to be executed and the number of people available to execute those tasks. Sometimes it's 3 people per task, sometimes it's 1 person for 10 tasks, but eventually after approximately 3 hours, task distributions even out to where they're going to be for the rest of the day right before the first wave of people hit the store.</p>\n<p>Specifically today, nothing new happened. There were a few shenanigans from Diet Coke Lady as she effervescently pestered the folks around the line for money as per usual. She has some grotesque lipstick action going on, and honestly, I just feel bad for her at this point. Doesn't mean I'll give her free sh*t, she's got a horrible attitude and doesn't try to better her situation at least while she's around, so until that changes that's a no from me, dawg.</p>\n<p>I still feel bad for the lady that lost her husband to covid though.

Even the coworkers that normally smile at me were kinda meh, and I'm not sure if this is always the case, but I actually witnessed some teamwork friction as a guy from one department complained about how he's the only one that gets tasked with doing different assignments when there are other people available…. Sounds like a personal problem than a task-sharing problem, especially since teamwork makes the dreamwork, and not to gloat, but the cashiers at the front have task loads pretty much figured out and (at least no one has vocalized to me personally) we get our sh*t done between the AM and PM teams fairly consistently. I even witnessed some major beef between one of the Men and a long time employee, so maybe today wasn't the day to go asking around for a raise or some health coverage 😂😂</p>\n<p>Work shenanigans aside, life definitely took its toll right at closing -- today we got 100% confirmation of a store regular that bought in bulk that died of coronavirus, and though my personal history with the man that passed didn't start out on the right foot, we eventually found new footing and he was always a pleasure to work with. Very courteous, and very hands-on while he helped his wife load their purchases onto their cart and into their car.

Right off the bat, before anything had even happened and definitely before I had even clocked in, I came across this beauty</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bu5ConaB<s>a</s><strong>i</strong>a BUSConoBia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And with a phone number, written on the sign that hangs off the office counter that tells people to practice social distancing. What's that beauty say? It says \"Looking for girlfriend\", but spelled \"LOKINGPHORGRILFRED\"</p>\n<p>Some dude out there felt lonely and horny and said to himself \"Tinder? WhatsApp? Facebook? Nah fam\" and just put himself out there, shit handwriting and spelling and all on a piece of paper and let Jesus take the wheel. This man, whoever he is, singlehandedly invalidated anyone's doubts about asking that special someone out on a date, so biiiig props to the ballsy move. Hopefully he finds someone that knows how to read ∠(`-` )</p>\n<p>So it turns out that people are still interested in purchasing the GIANT packs of toilet paper from when there was a toilet paper shortage from the initial coronavirus scare because some man walked in with his kid exclusively to buy one. Ngl, that thing brought back some nasty flashbacks to days on end where we had to argue with people to not be greedy assholes and buy all the toilet paper they could just because there was a shortage, and that was pretty evident in the way that Militant Man hesitated for a second to go figure out how much that thing costs. In the end, he bought it for $43 plus tax, but damn this man really just went through a year's worth in 4 months, so either he's got a big ass family, or ya know… But that's none of my business lmaoo</p>\n<p>Militant Man didn't earn his nickname from me out of nothingness. He's stern, direct, and will constantly give you tasks to execute. Idling is a no-go for him (hence why it's so rare to ever see him pause like I witnessed and why I mentioned it in a blog post), and in the approximately 20 years that I know he's been working at this store, he has mastered the art of interacting with the people of Latino background, from the most urban setting to the ranchiest of the ranch people whose Spanish I can't even understand as a native speaker. And yet, even the Militant Man himself has his cryptonite customer, and it's an older Karen that from now on will be known as Crypto Knight.</p>\n<p>She's got it all baby. The short hair, the age, the stubby, tubby body, the nails, the jewelry, and the God awful piercing voice that reaches into the carcass of your once youthful and hopeful soul and eviscerates the little life left. From the moment she walked into the store, Militant Man hurried off to me and told me, straight up (not verbatim, but very heavily implied)</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Careful with this woman man she's the f*cking crazy police.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh god.</p>\n<p>Well, I've got my ways of dealing with these Karens, and thankfully it helps that I look like an older teenager when I'm clean shaven so they tend to cut me some slack for trying to hold the price and mask rules firmly in place. Sometimes they'll even laugh at the dumb shit I say on the fly to try and keep things going smoothly and get 'em outta here before I want to yank my hair out and quit for the day, but this Karen wasn't having any of that. Thankfully, she ignored my existence and spoke only to Militant Man directly, and when he wasn't around, she went and hunted his ass down, and made it clear as daylight that she wanted her TACO MEAT PASSED TWICE UNDER THE GRINDER.</p>\n<p>God bless America, and the meat department people and Militant Man for handling this beast, because even after Militant Man continually told Crypto Knight that the meat was passed twice under the meat grinder, she got annoyed at the time delay and started getting loud and rowdy. At one point, Militant Man had enough and just started telling her the meat had been PASSED TWICE. IT'S PASSED TWICE HERE WE GO LOOK PASSED TWICE. She got fed up and started physically slapping Militant Man and chasing him around the register. Hoooly shit wow. It had a playful touch to it, but with these Men, it's hard to tell when something is foul play and when something is dead serious anger. Thankfully, today it was play and Crypto Knight left and everything was well.</p>\n<p>After she was gone, Militant Man just looked at me and said</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I told you man, when that woman comes in here I need everything to be perfect because she's worse than the police.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DAMN KAREN YOU SCARY CUH.</p>"},{"date":"7/3/2020 16:10:50","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"I got sexually hair-assed today.","link":"https://gfycat.com/aridmeanjapanesebeetle`video/mp4","content":"<p>This morning brought in the Princess Brothers to the store. They are a couple of grown ass men that have little-to-no respect for anyone working here, and have no problems saying gross, reprehensible things in a loud voice for everyone and their mom to hear. In the days when the mask order for businesses went into effect, one of the Princess Brothers loudly and angrily yelled at a coworker for reminding him to wear a mask that it's not that big of a deal if he doesn't wear one, and that if he covers his face with his shirt it's the same as wearing a mask made out of a shirt. But pretty boy over here didn't stop there -- he kept on ranting and ranting about how this mask business is bs, and after a couple of minutes decided to get his foul-mouthed Princes Bro and just left. Today though, the Princess Brothers ordered <strong>EGGS WITH WEED</strong> and then bought god knows what else and left without so much as saying hello. Good fkn riddance.</p>\n<p>But the real shenanigan of the day came from some old man that apparently doesn't know what hair is. So this dude comes to my register to pay for tacos or whatever, and so far so good. I've personally never seen him before, or if I have, he's definitely not a regular since I don't recognize him. He starts handing me his taco slip and drinks, and then he says \"Dang you have a lot of hair\". I couldn't really hear him through the loud fan and the music, but more importantly, I didn't want to believe that a grown ass man made a comment about my body hair so I said \"Huh?\". And he repeated himself</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are one <em>hairy</em> boy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lmfao 'scuse me….. what the fuck?? I thought I had heard it all, or at least, I couldn't be surprised by the unexpected with these people, and yet today proved me otherwise. I thought that would be the end of it, so I just said \"I guess, I mean I don't really pay attention to my body hair\". And I checked him out and he left. I started laughing my ass off after that because never in a billion years did I expect for some total fuckin' grown ass stranger to comment on my body hair like he's never seen that sh*t before. I'm not even that hairy, it's just that I have long arm hair so whatever.</p>\n<p>But this man wasn't done, noooooo sir. He apparently, in the time that I was completely distracted by his commentary, went back and ordered more food from the taqueria, and he came back to my register. He said, \"It's me again. Here you go my hairy man\". Ooooooo…. at that point, it wasn't cute or funny anymore, but I wasn't about to start some sh*t before the sun rose, so I just brushed it off and ignored him. <strong><em>AND THEN HE ASKED ME IF I HAVE CHEST HAIR TOO</em></strong> 😵😂😂😂 I lost a little bit of my composure, and I responded to him, verbatim, \"Shit man. Yeah, I have chest hair. I ain't no spring chicken my guy; I've been done with puberty for at least a decade bro I'm 25\", and I guess he wasn't expecting that kind of a response because he sort of just awkwardly laughed and didn't really say much after that. Damn that was a weird exchange of words.</p>\n<p>Grape Man is out of jail! Or at least, he was back this morning to shop for some stuff after being MIA for 2 or 3 days. Nothing spectacular other than buying 4 and commenting on how one time he accidentally asked for a coworker to get him his precious goodies, but he didn't realize that they were off and only here for their check, so he felt bad for interrupting them while off the clock 😭😭</p>\n<p>And finally, on today's edition of stoopid.

Instead of taking their shiny new card out though, the man pulls out his phone and starts making a phone call.</p>\n<p>\"Shit, it's gonna be one of those transactions\" was my first thought, since a lot of people wait until they are at the register to call whoever the actual owner of their card is for the PIN.

The worst part is that it took me a couple of minutes to register what this man was doing because it's such a rookie error, you'd think they're little kids trying to figure out how to pay alone for the first time 🤦‍♂️ It's almost as bad as that lady that often leaves her debit card at home, so she waits in the f*cking line while her hubby goes all the way home to get her card, like…. wtf is wrong with you.</p>\n<p>*sigh*</p>\n<p>On the plus side, I've been working on getting my store playlist accessible through this page sometime in the near future, so that's in the works behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>YEET.</p>"},{"date":"6/30/2020 22:18:23","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Am dumb, ✓; am hard worker, also ✓","link":"https://giphy.com/gifs/the-simpsons-stupid-oFRI4g517yWaI`video/mp4","content":"<p>I was supposed to be off, but I clocked in and worked almost 2 hours okay whatever.

So apparently this old dude showed up out of nowhere like all old men tend to do, and had the munchies on the third-trimester order. No problem, the store specializes in meeting all of your crunchy, salty, sweet, sour, dry, moist, gummy, fuzzy, alcoholic cravings for all hours of the day. This man's particular munchies -- hot sauce and chips. In a classic twist of events, right before the transaction was about to go down and everybody would move on with their life, the man dropped his bottle of Valentina hot sauce and stank up the place in a way that only that hot sauce knows how to do. F*ck, at least it cleans up okay with some deodorizer and a broom after a few hours, so no biggie. But in the commotion of everything going on and the lack of caring for whatever the man was doing, his transaction eventually ended and it was time to move on to the next task at hand.</p>\n<p>A mere five minutes tops after dingus man left, he came back and declared that he apparently \"wasn't given his chips and avocado\" even though QtSteel was almost certain that he took everything he had brought to the register to get charged. The story would have ended there and dingus man would have probably been given another set of his declared missing items… if he had brought his receipt. It's a common sense thing to have when declaring these kinds of issues literally at any store anywhere in the Texas borders, and yet, dingus man was still surprised that he was asked to bring proof of purchase 🤦‍♂️ I've seen kindergarteners understand basic stuff like this way faster than fully grown adults, I swear.

Who knows if any of those expenses apply to Diet Coke Lady, but her moves today definitely strike high on the desperation scale. She was on the prowl for more free goodies, and her strategy today was to come right around the time the morning cashiers were ending their shift and afternoon cashiers are starting. But now, unlike before, she's walking into the store knowing full well she has no money, and then bothers people right as she is \"paying\" to score some extra mercy/pressure points and have someone bail her out. On the one hand, feelsbadman, but on the other, this is so f*cking annoying to deal with I might just tell her to stop bothering people at least while they're in line. </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>THAT FACE WHEN YOU'RE SO KEEN ON GETTING FREE SHIT YOU KNOW WHEN THE CASHIERS CHANGE SHIFT TO TRY AND GET DOUBLE FREE GOODIES</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But enough about this crazy woman. The real fun shenanigan of the day was brought to you in part by myself, Josad Major, and a King-class customer. Normally, every Sunday involves me taking orders and gathering items into carts to get them charged and then either delivering them myself or someone else delivering them via the store van. This King-class customer mixed up the usual order today and wanted a \"box of aluminum\". That could mean anything from one tube of rolled up aluminum (which comes in a gazillion varieties), to sheets of aluminum (which also come in different sizes). I ended up having to call them and ask to clarify what they meant, and it turns out that they wanted the aluminum sheets for tacos. No worries, ezpz lemon squeezy. I gathered their loot, put a single box of aluminum foil sheets for tacos, Boss Man charged it all up, and it was sent to their location.</p>\n<p>The real problem surfaced a couple of hours later when Boss Man sent Josad Major to their location to exchange money; usually these King-class customers ask for little bills to give change for large bills, but I guess that Boss Man forgot to send it with the major order. Well, it turns out that some crazy bitch at this taqueria went full ham on Josad Major's ass because even though he was sent exclusively for exchanging the money, the lady in charge was not going to give him anything until she got her aluminum 😂😂😂 Josad Major literally didn't know what the actual f was going on and why he was fighting this woman for what should have been a straightforward exchange, so he ended up calling Boss Man and talking to her on the phone because apparently it was turning into a giant shitshow LMAOO Poor Josad Major.</p>\n<p>In the end, Boss Man ended up apologizing and sending them their aluminum and whatnot, and he ended up blaming me for the whole ordeal. I didn't think much of it, since it's whatever and crazy bitches be crazy, but after Boss Man hung up the phone with the lady he started laughing his ass off and calling that woman crazy and how she was dumb because even after calling her to verify the order she still couldn't get it right.</p>\n<p>Fucking A 😂</p>"},{"date":"6/27/2020 15:22:46","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"More or less my journey here with a few tweaks here and there.","link":"`image/png","content":"<p>Happy anniversary to me 🤪 Original comics are found <a href=\"http://www.insertlifehere.net/comic/100-college/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.insertlifehere.net/comic/106-job-hunt/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.insertlifehere.net/comic/108-graduate-school/\">and here</a>.</p>"},{"date":"6/26/2020 14:40:47","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Forgot to use the crackhead repellent this morning... oops","link":"`image/png","content":"<p>Call it Bastions of the Mentally Deranged and Deep State Opposition 2 out here; these crackheads and crazy people were all over the store just doing what they do best -- be in your face.

The lady was holding a phone, so she clearly wasn't a street regular; she almost looked like someone that agreed to meet with someone but she didn't know what that other person looked like, like a Tinder date. So, she's now known as Tinder Girl, and whether or not she was asking for money or not, I told her that she should leave, and she just looked at me weird as asked Why? lmao cuz u bein' weird sugar and you're not in control of whether you're welcome on a business property or not.

Coronavirus is no joke, and it's not going away because people get tired of dealing with it. Even though at the time of this writing information on the virus is relatively new (less than a year vs decades for other, well-known pathogens/viruses), it's been confirmed by studies around the world by scientists working around the clock that this thing is especially dangerous to those with compromised immune systems, children, and the elderly. At this point in time it should come of no surprise that the general consensus by health authorities is that one should continue to avoid exposure as much as possible until a vaccine or heard immunity is reached -- this means not now, but maybe in a year or potentially even longer.</p>\n<p>Like I mentioned in another earlier post, the county judge ordered that face masks <em>must be worn in locations where social distancing is not physically possible</em>. This 100% means that our location is not exempted, and so it's our duty to do our part and enforce mask usage from the general population that walks in. I've had to deal with apathy by part of some coworkers and even the freaking Men, and so it's a two-front battle that needs to be won. Thankfully, today there were much fewer people walking into the store without a face mask, and those that did were very compliant with obtaining or buying one to shop.</p>\n<p>But this one woman really went full stupid today. Thankfully, she didn't get physically or verbally abusive; that would probably get the cops called on her. She was wearing a mask, so no one really paid any attention to her on her way in, but close behind her walked in a child without a face mask. I never noticed the kid since he's short and my view was blocked, but a few minutes later I saw Female Me walking behind her talking about masks and the like, and their body language wasn't positive so I decided to go check what was going on, and I almost immediately wished I didn't see anything.</p>\n<p>This masked adult woman was arguing with Female Me over why her child doesn't need to be wearing a mask. He HaS aStHmA aNd ThE rUlEs SaY tHaT oNlY cHiLdReN oVeR 10 aRe ReQuIrEd tO wEaR a MaSk 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😐🔫 This woman brought her CHILD with ASTHMA to a grocery store, aka <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs\">a mathematically proven breeding ground for any pathogen</a> (and God knows what other inappropriate places this poor kid has been taken to prior to this rule being in effect). Setting aside the extra vulnerability of this child, I've heard stories from nurses that work in hospitals that coronavirus does way worse things inside of a child's body than in an adult's, and with cases surging in Texas as people realize that reopening too soon was definitely a bad idea, it's only a matter of time before the virus reaches critical mass and everyone knows someone, or themselves becomes, infected. I'm sure that this ranks for some sort of abuse by ignorance in some law somewhere, right alongside child obesity, but that's a whole other can of worms not eligible for discussion here.</p>\n<p>But covid shenanigans aside for a second -- I have finally found the Goddess among men. She is the Chosen One, the one who knows how to pass EBT manually where even Militant Man had no power. Female Me surprised me with this beautiful token today, and finally all of the rumors from customers claiming to have recently have their transactions work by hand suddenly don't sound like hogwash to get me to do their bidding lmao.

Ignoring the national/world events currently taking place, I never imagined all of the people, the customers, the coworkers, the interactions, the prices, and on and on and on that I would grow to love and hate in such a short (albeit eternally feeling) period of time.

I've worked with people that I got to just barely know before they moved on with their life. I've worked with people that left and came back, and left again because why not. I've spent well over 100 hours outside of work just to finding and assembling a good playlist that doesn't sound repetitive for me and those that have to be there with me the entire time.

She always ALWAYS walks off to the other side of the store and takes her sweet time getting forgotten item after forgotten item, and even when the line behind her has grown beyond Boss Man's tolerance, she STILL has the gall to WALK to get more stuff.

I know that's where our tamale meat comes from, but something about pig is just super upsetting to me.

When I'm alone up front like that, I keep an extra eye out for any customer that wants to come in shopping 🤢🤮 before I'm done opening up, I don't keep them waiting too long since being caught away from the register first thing in the morning by the Man in charge would be très bad. It's literally impossible to sneak into the store without me being aware since there's no noise other than the coffee machine and the taqueras in the kitchen moving trays around and what-not. Yet, somehow, an old man managed to f*cking teleport to the cash register and was waiting god knows how long because he gave me a quick attention holler. Granted, customers tend to call to your attention if you're away from the register for 0.0001 seconds, so take my wait time comment with a healthy dose of salt. Also, he was dressed in shorts and sandals, and had a 110% pillowhead action going on so clearly he still had some time to do whatever it is that people that go buying at the store this freaking early do, but I just can't believe either how unaware I am, or just how sneaky people can be. Jesus christ, this man could have gone all OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU on me and I would be dead before the even sun shone.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few hours, and it's slow as hell for a morning shift. I'm talking about Sunday-afternoon-right-as-Monday's-responsibilities-start-to-hit-you-full-stop type slow. This girl Eevee is nowhere to be seen since she very obviously asked for the day off for who knows why, so I'm working with Female Me on the primary cash register and she's asking get-to-know-you questions. She's pretty cool and fun to work with, so that took the dullness out of the morning some.</p>\n<p>Diet Coke Lady and Grape Man both made special visits today as well. She got her usual minus the cigars and left, so nothing spectacular there. Grape Man got his usual too, and on top of that he brought along his trademarked tinfoil hat commentary. This time, instead of turning off my brain and just laughing at the barrage of words, I decided to pay attention and later write down his train of thought for history's sake. Here goes….</p>\n<p>So, he starts talking about some random tea the person ahead of him bought and how tea in general is good for you. So far so normal. He brings up an old, nasty dog bite that he got a few months ago and starts talking about the antioxidants in the tea and how they are able to treat inflammations like the one he had on his arm. That's when shit hits the fan. He mentions how the tea that person got is extra good because you can water it down and it still doesn't lose its potency, so it's an economic choice for treating the inflammation. Inflammation is bad for you because it constricts the veins and arteries in the aflicted area, and so cholesterol and fat deposits get lodged in there, which can lead to an embolism, but also a collection of heavy metals. From his research that he always does, he also learns about quantum gravity, and the 5G network and Big Comm's mission to suppress how 5G signals interact with the heavy metals in vaccines that then get injected into people because doctors that prepare the vaccine viles don't properly shake the viles and so when they inject the vaccine, the heavy metals deposit on the bottom of the vile and so some people get more metals than others into their systems. This, in turn, affects their blood cells, and more specifically, their hemoglobin molecular polarity. And then he stopped because he finally finished his transaction and just cut off and left. I cannot make this up, and it's hilarious to listen to every single time. Also, this is from what I remember hours after it happened and from a few notes that I was able to squeeze onto a small sheet of paper. What I wrote above is wayyyyyy more coherent, and possibly a different order, than what came out of Grape Man's mouth. So next time I bring up the man, you can make a safe bet he hit one of the topics I recorded lmao.</p>\n<p>However, the realest and most hilariously relatable story of the day is from Militant Man himself. I've only been working here for a year, and I've already become numb to certain scenarios and problems that arise on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, so I imagine that what I feel is nothing compared to what Militant Man and the other Men (except maybe Big Boss, he don't give a shit) feel. So, it's another EBT transaction, and like many other stories I've written about here, this one involves a techincal issue because our POS really should stand for piece of sh*t. The lady's magnetic stripe is out of order, and she assumes that this is a valid store with perfectly functioning payment equipment. What she doesn't know, like so many before her, is that no one that I know of at this store knows how to enter EBT manually and have it go through, but she claims that it's been done here before (just like the pickle juice lady from another blog entry), so I take her word for it and assume that it's Militant Man with his integrated knowledge of our POS that magically knows what to press to make it work. So I go search for him and I find him busy-as-ever and drop the EBT bomb on him. Even though his face is hidden behind three layers of face masks, it doesn't take much to know that he's got that not-this-shit-again face. It was at this point that I knew…. this was gonna suck for all parties involved.</p>\n<p>So back to my register we go, and I proceed to take the first few steps with Militant Man watching behind. I entered all of the numbers on the card, including the ones that the Texas government, for whatever reason, decided to hide on the bottom left corner of the card. Then, our POS system asked for an expiration date, and I looked back at Militant Man to get some cue as to what to do. Instead, right as I made eye contact I just see him slowly fade into the background noise, his eyes glaze over, and I'm 99.99% sure he said \"I don't know\" 😂🤣🤣🤣 This man has seen all kinds of shit that there is to be seen, and I could tell that he wasn't thinking about what was happening in front of him and instead was probably thinking about how much longer he has to work to safely retire and never EVER come back through those doors again. I mean, I'm not sure if my words capture it well, but his face went blank. Zero. Zilch. For a solid 5-10 seconds, he stood there motionless. This Man's level of jadedness, apathy, stone-cold mechanical exasperation was unlike anything I've seen IRL in another human being. Maybe he just had so many other more important things to worry about and this was eating away precious time, but the void he made finally collapsed and he snapped back into reality by asking for the EBT card and trying the magnetic strip. In the end, the EBT transaction failed, and Militant Man let them be $4 short by taking whatever cash they had on hand and let them leave. Nineteen more years of this and I'll be right there with Militant Man; Jesus save us.</p>"},{"date":"6/17/2020 15:28:10","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Maybe one day they will realize what's really going on here.","link":"https://gfycat.com/jointmildhousefly-steve-carell`video/mp4","content":"<p>Signs are found throughout the store in every direction that you look, which I find to be problematic when it comes to an aesthetically pleasing store experience upon walking in for the first time. </p>\n<p>Elegant solutions to this problem are difficult to realize, not only because the information on those signs is necessary, it helps let customers know what is going on their own terms.

Credit Man went up to Boss Man, went all macho pancho with him, and after the coordial ritual was complete, he came to my register and ordered me to let him sign the receipt and call it a day. Call it the ole fool-me-once, but I wasn't going to have any shenanigans with the Boss Man over Credit Man again, so I didn't listen to what Credit Man was claiming and went straight to the Boss Man and told him what was going down. Boss Man made it veeery clear that he had zero intention on giving him any additional credit, especially since he just discarded his signed receipt yesterday like it was nothing, and I made sure to pass on that message to Credit Man. Maybe it's because Boss Man play fights with men like him all the time, but for some reason, it wasn't sinking into this man's brain that zero credit means 0, as in squat shit, as in pay up or shut up, so he kept coming back to my register and claiming that Boss Man had okayed the signing. It was a back and forth between Credit Man and Boss Man, until right at the end the poor woman that was kept waiting because of the whole ordeal generously decided to pay for Credit Man's food and let him leave. Even in the face of pure generosity that I made extra sure that she was okay with (my biggest respect to this woman, seriously), Credit Man was still claiming that he was leaving on a sign off and lying about having paid what he owed. For this man's sake, I hope that it's rent and utilities that came up and he's struggling to make ends meet, but I'm almost fairly certain that it's destructive habits and a violently self-harming lifestyle that has him asking for credit two days in a row. Either way, the last thing that I want is for Credit Man to get the wrong idea about me denying his signing, especially since he knows where I live and I definitely do NOT want him showing up to my house on a friendly visit 👊👊👊</p>\n<p>jChief's on comedy 🔥🔥🔥 two days in a row now.

With the next major holiday a few weeks away and no major sporting events on the horizon anytime soon, activity was kept to a modest few wholesale transactions, and a bulk number of small-to-medium-sized grocery purchases. Grape Man swung by and bought some cigars, told who knows what to QtSteel, and dipped into the afternoon sunset while leaving a wake of b.o., nicotine, and alcohol. Standard stuff, but the idiot story of the day is brought to you by jChief. Maybe it's the daily exposure to bleach and ammonia, or maybe it's the tightness of this boy's cap around his knoggin', but whatever the real cause may be, this dude went full stoopid today and it struck me right in the giggle dick.</p>\n<p>For some background jChief usually comes paired with Earnest Chief, and usually start their day by hauling Boss Man's loot from Sam's Club into the store, and this afternoon was no exception. Some time afterward, jChief got an order to fill for a man that was physically present in the store, and at some point during the order, the man wanted a bag of dried chilli peppers. Normally, this isn't an issue, but the problem with the bags is that they come perforated to allow for airflow and whatnot. For storage and travel, these bags are fine, but they're not fine for handling in your face and tossing around to shake out excess debris before handing it over to someone in a poorly ventilated area…… which jChief did. Him and the man apparently got the sneezes pretty bad, and even after a few minutes of essentially pepper spraying themselves, I would catch myself coughing because of the secondhand chilli debris that was coming off of their clothing. jChief said that he shook it harder because at first it smelled good 🤦‍♂️😂😂🤣 What a fucking idiot. But he's our idiot &lt;3</p>\n<p>Imagine for a second that you're wearing bright pink underwear, and then imagine for another second that you left your fly down while shopping at the store. Nobody asked me to catch some cameltoe today, but this poor lady just had everything out there and it was very hard to take her seriously while she was talking to me about our transaction. I debated whether or not to do anything about it, but in the end I figured that I would want someone to discretely tell me, so I let her know what was up. Or in this case, down.</p>\n<p>One of the bigger mysteries of this business is how one goes from being a total stranger, to being creditable enough with Boss Man to have the balls to ask him for credit for purchases. Over my time period working here, I've gotten to know the regulars that ask the Man for credit, and almost all of the time they pay him back in full (mostly because he actually gives them a call like the collection agency that he is). This one dude though, I don't know how he manages to convince him to get credit since he very obviously lives a drunk lifestyle (I can actually confirm this bias because I know where the man lives and very often see him drinking beer out on his porch). I asked Boss Man if it was okay for him to sign his account for $36 including beer, and after he reluctantly said yes, the man proceeded to scribble some random garbage on the receipt and then toss out his copy because he has zero intention of paying it back. I've heard this man speak before, and it's very present that he holds a grudge against the Men for having wealth while he has to live such a garbage lifestyle. He feels dangerously entitled to claim back some of the wealth he feels is kept from him, when in reality it's himself that holds the biggest barrier to moving forward. I know this because I see his choices, and I see how hard others in his peer group work to put their families and best interests first with blood, sweat, tears, and general wholesomeness that is very hard to come by people that don't fully know or understand what it's like to grow up in a poor environment. Didn't mean to go on a morality rant like that, but it is sad to see this and sort of just shrug and write about coworkers snorting chilli pepper. ANYWAY.</p>\n<p>It happened. It actually f*cking happened……..</p>\n<p>We only have 1 basket left. I got the biggest confirmation to date from Boss Man about the basket situation. He said \"hopefully\" he remembers to bring the new ones tomorrow (I sincerely doubt he'll remember until maybe 3 days from now, assuming he actually has the baskets on-hand at home or somewhere). </p>\n<p>This has been the latest information regarding petty issues happening at a local grocery store in a small suburb of Texas.

I don't know if it was the hour lateness, or my developing aspartame addiction, or my age, but my energy levels were low low low low for the first 3 hours or work hooooooly moly. At one point, my head was hurting too, so big yikes.</p>\n<p>But personal issues aside, it seems that today was a fairly standard day. Everything went along buttery smooth after a proper team of cashiers was assembled, and no one had any issues whatsoever in any transactions that happened until close. Except that that is a fucking lie, and people are dumb as ever.</p>\n<p>OOOOOOooooOOooooooo 😤😤😤</p>\n<p>Ok, so let me start by clarifying that yes, I fucked up a transaction multiple times, and I also had super shitty fucking luck in the order that I fucked up and the manner that the transaction was handled. But basically, I committed an innocent typo (in our store, the code for cilantro is 221, and instead of hitting ENTER to charge a price unit of cilantros, I hit the BEER button instead. This registered on the account as a taxable, non-food item, and because the price unit of cilantros is 4 for $1.29, I ended up charging 4 packs of $2.21 in beer, marking a grand total of $8.84 plus tax for something that should have been a $1.29 produce charge. Ok, no worries I thought. I've done this mistake like 10 times up to that point today, and a hundred gazillion times a week since I started working here. But, fuckup #2, instead of removing the beer charge by voiding from the BEER modifier button, I voided $8.84 of MEAT. Fuck, well at least the net charge was brought to close enough to zero that it didn't really matter since this was a business purchase that was asking for discounted price. I reached the end of the transaction, and fuckup #3, I failed to realize that the lady was paying with Lone Star, which spoiler alert, doesn't pay for beer. Once the transaction had gone through, there was still $9.57 left to pay with cash. So, after inspecting the receipt for why there was still an amount left to charge, I found my fuckup #2 and mended it by basically properly going through and making sure that fuckups #1 and #2 were correctly undone. As an exercise to the reader, see if you can figure out how you should undo those errors without cancelling the entire transaction, then read what I did and see if we come up with the same result… … … …</p>\n<p>So first, I started by properly removing the $8.84 of BEER by doing VOID 884 BEER. This brings the net total of taxable non-food items to 0. There's still a void of $8.84 in MEAT left in the account that's now left unbalanced, so I fixed that by re-adding $8.84 to the grand total through GROCERY (not MEAT since at this point I was kind of flustered trying to explain to the lady what had gone wrong, but it doesn't really matter because they're both Lone Star eligible). In summary, 8.84 of BEER - 8.84 of BEER = 0, and -8.84 of MEAT + 8.84 of GROCERY = 0, and when something is 0, it doesn't change the amount of the total if you add it, subtract it, lick it, or suck it. I genuinely need for someone to verify that this isn't a hard thing to understand, but if it is, you're uneducated and need to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBf25kNs0tA\">go back to 3rd grade alebra with pawns and a balance and shit</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now it should be obvious to anyone properly following what is happening that the transaction total is still the same total that it was prior to pressing all of those dumb fucken buttons, but if not, that's okay. It's fucking balanced. Anyway, this means that now there's still a charge left of $8.84 left to pay, but with GROCERY, which is now eligible for the woman to pay with Lone Star and finish and fucking leave. Except that as soon as I tried explaining to her what had happened, her brain got stuck on \"I dId'Nt BuY bEeR wHy Is ThAt BeInG cHaRgEd I gOt CiLaNtRo WhY dO i StIlL nEeD tO pAy\". Like, I get that it's not an everyday type of error that one encounters when one goes shopping, but what should have been an easy explanation to a medium difficulty problem turned into a giant fucking shitshow with Boss Man yelling through the mic that WE NEED TO MOVE THE LINE 😂😂😂</p>\n<p>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</p>\n<p>And it doesn't end there.</p>\n<p>Boss Man comes out of his mancave to inspect the damage and 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨 ball bust into moving the line (understandable since the line at this point was stupid long), and after literally doing the same thing that I did (add $8.84 of GROCERY) without even consenting or trying to explain to the woman why she needs to pay the $8.84, her total rose to $17.68 because Boss Man completely ignored that I had already added the missing amount back 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ So, he nuked the whole thing, and everybody agreed that the transaction would be charged from scratch again. The lady's daughter? had already taken the cart and the items to their car, so she had to go get everything again, load it into the cart, and bring it back into the store. At this point, I'm in disbelief at how big this thing has become, and I'm seriously super confused why it could be so hard to understand the scope of the issue at hand. Anyway, Big Boss's daughter came in to the rescue and helped me by recharging everything on her account, but without the voids and the groceries and the meats and the whatever, and once her total was pretty much the same as last time, she STILL GOT THE RECEIPTS AND COMPARED THEM. I just wanted to see that I wasn't going crazy, and while I was looking through to make sure that she had been charged $8 more just like I had re-added to her account and put all of her braincells to overdrive, both I and Big Boss's daugher noticed that she hadn't brought back the Bimbo breads that she had bought. This bitch got a discount for not knowing math, AND to add salt to the wound, she literally told Big Boss's daughter to not interrupt me and her while I was explaining to her that her Lone Star card wasn't overcharged. Big Boss's daugher got MAD lmaooo</p>\n<p>I swear if she comes in tomorrow to claim that her Lone Star card was charged twice I'm gonna fucking quit this job.</p>"},{"date":"6/11/2020 19:34:48","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Hamburger bread is king, and we its entourage","link":"https://tenor.com/view/hamburglar-mc-donalds-hamburgers-hamburger-80s-gif-12540295`image/gif","content":"<p>When I first arrived at this job, all I saw were mountains and mountains of hamburger bread just waiting to be packed.

Today's flashback edition: near death instances.</p>\n<p>While a lot of professionally run businesses divert their profits back into their companies for quality of life improvement and expansion, this little puppy right here has the bare minimum of that. You don't have to look very far to see old, tattered equipment <em>still in use</em> from 20 years ago. In fact, I believe that their parking lot hasn't been redone since The Men bought the damn thing, but the equipment in question is the cash registers. It's very obvious that they've taken a hard beating for at least the past decade, and quite possibly for longer since no one is either knowledgeable enough or caring enough to try and fix some of the bigger mechanical or digital issues with the registers. For example, all registers claim to have Apple Pay, but it's a coin toss whether or not the thing is working, and it's impossible to explain to someone that has no knowledge of how the system works that if the card reader doesn't have green dots, it's not working (if you know what I'm talking about, you know, and if you don't, my point is proven). Or worse, register 2's hood isn't fixed in place by screws or anything, only by a single corner that properly slides into a small crevice in the register frame. What this means is that it often violently falls on the floor, and more often than not, there are children or elderly people right where it can damage their feet or what have you. A more seemingly innocent issue with the registers is that they will periodically stop scanning/weighing items. For the longest time, I assumed that these problems were easily fixable by resetting the scanner. I had done it a dozen times up until this point, and when Kintsu's register presented the problem, I felt confident that I could fix it for him and get things running again. I confidently told him to step aside and let a professional handle it, and as I reached into the wiring of the register to unplug the scanner to reset it, I ended up touching a conduit pipe and…</p>\n<p>GUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>\n<p>I felt a big electric shock across the span of my arms and chest, and after at least a quarter of a second, I finally reacted to let go of the damn thing. I was very literally in shock, and I could still feel the electric disturbance in my chest near my heart 😀 Up until that point in my life, I've had maybe 1 or 2 close calls with live wires, but this one came the fuck out of nowhere. Maybe it's my lack of electrical knowledge, but one would assume that something that has to be manhandled frequently like a register at a store wouldn't have fucking electrically charged covered wires, but not here, no sir. I took a couple of minutes to reflect on what had just happened because I needed to retrace why I had gotten shocked so bad, and then I finally realized it's most likely because someone taped wires together inside the pipe and there was contact where there shouldn't be, and because I was holding onto the metal hood with my left arm while I was poking around with my right and I set myself up for that nasty ground discharge path. I got the sweats afterward, as one naturally does with a near death experience, but at least in my case, if that had been it for me, at least I would have died satisfied, knowing that I've done what I can and what I've wanted to within my moral and financial constraints.</p>\n<p>A second, non personally near death experience but definitely a hazardous one, was the time that the AC unit in the ceiling fell in the middle of rush hour with people walking around because the people in charge of installing it didn't properly secure it before removing the supporting structure while trying to change it out. Now THAT was a shitshow, both because when it fell, it didn't fall all the way to the floor (it got held up by the tortilla shelf and a corner of the ceiling tile), and customers weren't securing their children from walking under or near it while it was very possibly hanging on by something that wasn't designed to hold 200+ pounds of equipment and could have definitely taken the final plunge to the floor. After a couple of hours of watching frantic workers try and carefully lower it to the ground and breathing possibly asbestos since the pink fluffy insulation in the ceiling hasn't been changed since the store was bought because why would it, the situation was finally put under control and thankfully no one was injured.</p>\n<p>Also, the store's money delivery person got robbed at gunpoint in 2019, so that must have been a wild day to work here.</p>\n<p>Imagine the number of near death stories from all other workers that have ever had the privilege to work here might have, jeez.</p>"},{"date":"6/9/2020 23:05:13","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Today was worse than meh, it was blugh.","link":"https://media.giphy.com/media/RKS1pHGiUUZ2g/giphy.gif`video/mp4","content":"<p>I swear, Grape Man and Big Boss's daughter make for some great content.

I unplug my phone from the charger, turn off my PC, slap on a face mask, grab my water bottle, and hit the road for another round of involuntary social interactions. God, what a pain to get off the car and walk in through those doors.. I slap on my public figure personality, drag my feet across the parking lot, and rush to my timesheet to clock in once more. It's not even the coronavirus that has me exhausted; it's the stagnation of a bunch of shitty, albeit could be worse, circumstances and events outside of my control that got me stuck swimming in molasses to move forward with my life.</p>\n<p>Then in comes the world renown Grape Man. Holy shit, the man, the myth, the legend. This man is pure gold, and he doesn't even know it. I'm at my register contemplating my existence, and this guy comes to the register behind me, and he doesn't say hi. No. He doesn't even address the current social context, weather, nor his 99¢ cigarettes. The very first words that come out of his mouth today -- IN RUSSIA 🤣😂🤣 He obviously couldn't see because of the mask, but I was already cracking up because it's gonna be good.</p>\n<p>\"In Russia, the only place that requires face masks is McDonald's\"</p>\n<p>Never change, Grape Man, never change. Do shower though, today you were specially smelly.</p>\n<p>After having my mind cleared from that interaction, I was officially in the game -- I was warmed up and dispatching customers lightning mcfast. Sometimes, I go so fast that customers aren't ready to pay when I tell them the total. Like, they stare at me wondering why I'm telling them a number (their total). This one middle aged woman though was wayyyy in lala land though. I told her her total, and not only did she struggle to figure out that I was finished; when she realized that she had to pay, she took out a $20 bill and tried to stick it into the card reader 🤦‍♂️😂 Even she realized how dumb that was, because she started laughing and laughing and honestly, it was contagious like coronavirus c;</p>\n<p>Usually, most of the time that I walk into the restroom and find some rando in there, interactions are awkward, and most of the time they walk out without washing their hands… WHY WHY WHY EWW. Today though, this numnuck stoopid ass perv walked into the restroom while I was using a urinal, and stood right behind me a couple of feet right where I could see him and he could see me. I turned around and made eye contact with him and he just stood there dumbfounded…….. I was so shocked that someone could be so fucking stupid and not realize how invasive they're being that I didn't tell him anything. In no scenario today did I imagine that I would have to tell a grown ass man that he shouldn't stand right behind me while I'm trying to pee, wow. When I finished, he told me to \"Go ahead\" and I was thiiiiiis close to asking him why he stood there watching me take a leak. Damn. Like, this is definitely tmi so look away now you've been warned….. … … … ok, so like, I'm not pee shy, which is especially helpful with the cramped ass restroom at work, but I almost felt my feed cut off from being so weirded out by the guy just standing there behind me lmao. I've said it before and I'll say it again -- these people are bots, prove me wrong 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Missed an opportunity to urinate on a grown man today. Never thought I'd tick that box off while being 100% sober.</p>\n<p>The afternoon after that fiasco was pretty standard though. Bimbo man came in and brought ants on one of his boxes and Boss Man went full 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨 ball buster mode on him and made me get Raid to spray on the bread to kill the ants lol And then a lady was buying hamburger supplies, and bought a pickle jar that I made the mistake of giving to a small child to carry (the child broke the jar, surprise surprise). After being showered by the pickle juice, I offered her the chance to go get another one while I cleaned up the mess, so she had her older daughter go get another jar. Then she wanted to pay with food stamps, but needed for me to type in the numbers manually since here magnetic stripe doesn't work. I don't have any issue with typing in numbers or anything like that, but I still don't know how to do that, and when I informed her of this, she told her little children that they were going to another store because \"they don't want to type in the numbers for me here\". This bitch, after all the work I went to replacing her broken pickle jar too, wowww.

It didn't seem so bad, just the usual weird shit he always buys like this VERY SPECIFIC BRAND OF SMOOTH PLATES OHMYGOD IF IT'S NOT THIS BRAND I WANT NOTHING, and caldo veggies. Except, that in my mind's eye, I didn't think that when the pedido said \"3 cabbage\", they meant 3 boxes of cabbage, so I just got this baldy 3 heads of cabbage and called it done. I fucking wish I was up front for this, it sounds like it would have been hilarious to watch from afar, but apparently, he made such a big god damned shitshow that his order WASN'T COMPLETE WHO THE FUCK DID THIS ORDER AHHHHH that even the taqueria ladies in the kitchen in the back were telling me about it LMAO. Jesus fuck now that's the Luisito I know. Fuck this man, but at the same time it's funny how stirred up he gets over minor details and very easily fixable problems……….. just like Boss Man.</p>\n<p>I also worked on a pedido for La Morenita; ezpz stuff and very straightforward to complete. Today, after the transaction was all said and done, it was time to load it up to their delivery man's truck, and it was just me and Chief.com to get that done. I would say that we both did about equal parts work getting it loaded in, but when their delivery guy came up to tip, he passed the money in front of Chief.com's face and said told me \"Here you go, thanks.\" UHHHHH lol I didn't want to be a dick and keep it all, so I gave Chief.com 30%, but shit man people really do be clear cut on how they perceive work gets done. Apparently, I have a very \"hard working demeanor\", but really I just think it's the light skin ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cash King came in today with half his face swollen from being in a fist fight.

As I imagined, the alarm clock this morning was just pure pain, like waking up for an 8am for college, but literally way fucking worse because it's out of necessity. And yet, somehow, there are people that see the doors open before 6am and just decide to start their day grocery shopping 🤮 Literally not even 10 minutes into opening, a crackhead couple walked into the store. Usually, when crackheads walk in bright and early in the morning, it means that they've been out and about and are looking for a quick fix of cigarettes or beer or something before moving on. This time though, these people got themselves a cart and started shopping around. In my time working here, I've only seen a handful of people that go 30+ minutes walking about shopping comparing prices and generally just taking their sweet time getting their errand done. No one batted an eye at this couple until 30, 40, 50 minutes went by and they were still walking around the store looking through item after item. After all the red flags had been raised, Militant Man went full, well, militant mode, just letting everyone know to keep an eye out for any funny business conducted by these people. I watched from afar how they went shelf by shelf, item by item, but neither of them had large bags or deep pockets to keep anything in, so I was just completely baffled, but mostly entertained by the prospect that someone would come in and first thing in the morning sack the store, especially before 6am.</p>\n<p>After the first morning rush of people trying to get their daily fix of coffee, I decided to go sleuthing and see what the deal with them was. I swear, these two were literally just casually shopping and reading the descriptions of every single item that they came across like it was their first time going shopping for themselves. They had a really nice demeanor, and I felt bad for judging them so harshly for their very obvious substance abuse. For example, the man would say \"Hey babe, come look at this soap. It says to use in HIGH EFFICIENCY machines!\" It really was that innocent of a trip, and I felt like an asshole for the rest of the time they were there. They ended up leaving around 7:30am, so they were easily in there for at least an hour and a half -- that's gotta be a record somewhere for genuine shopping time (they definitely won't beat this one old lady that comes in and takes like 3 hours to buy like 2 bags of cookies and a couple of vegetables and milk… that old lady is QUEEN at taking her sweet ass time, like not even The Men are willingly present that long in their own store lmao).</p>\n<p>My one year anniversary is coming up in 21 days, so woooo….</p>"},{"date":"6/5/2020 22:25:07","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Some days you start out feeling like $1000, then Boss Man comes in and gives you a reality check.","link":"https://giphy.com/gifs/htiVRuP7N0XK/html5`video/mp4","content":"<p>Today's fuck up of the day that didn't happen today: I accepted a $50 bill that didn't have both serial numbers.

Really puts a strain on how much longer I'll be able to put up with such open and raw reprimanding, but as soon as I take a look at the bank account, I just get sent riiiight back to my current state of affairs of having to work at this blessed grocery store.

Of course, as soon as that thing arrives at the store, everyone is most definitely mega screwed. You see masks down on people everywhere, especially the boss man, but depressing news aside, I find it cute how people start to make kid's sized masks! Like, look at their dumb little faces, so innocent and unjaded… This mom was walking in with 3 of her little girls, and the smallest one didn't have her mask on. For some reason, mamma didn't remember about her face covering until they were inside the store, so she takes out what I would assume is a face mask for herself that she had in her purse and put it on her before they got too far inside. But her face is very obviously too small, and as soon as mom put the thing on her face, it was like she took saran wrap and wrapped her entire face from forehead to chin 😂😂😭 Normally, I'd say fuck 'em kids, but the way the little girl stumbled then when mom finally realized what she had done and I just couldn't contain myself.

Grape Man DID comment on a coworker's outfit, so that's something I guess, but nothing else from them.</p>\n<p>This old man came in today and was getting whatever. The thing that caught my attention from him, though, was that this man was casually wearing some toenail clippers on his necklace like he needs to be ready at a moment's notice of a sudden pedicure. For some reason, I found this amusing, but I didn't really ask him any questions. He reminded me of another old man that used to swing by fairly regularly - Quarter Ear Man. He would walk around the store and do everything normally, except that he would have a quarter sticking out from either ear…..</p>\n<p>Right toward the end of the shift, I had to charge a cartfull of random stuff for these 3 super round ladies. I'm no health guru, but I've spent well over a year working on changing my body so I've learned a thing or two about food nutrition, and by working here for the past 11 months at the time of this writing, I've definitely noticed that the quantity and proportion of sugary and fatty foods that people buy are directly proportional to their apparent body mass index. In layman's terms, fat people buy hella junk food, and these 3 ladies were no exception to this observation -- Bimbo, sandwich supplies, sweet bread, candy, cooking oil, every cheese imaginable, etc..</p>\n<p>Once I was done charging their loot, the main one hollers at the other two \"Hey, y'all forgot to get the drinks. What are y'all gonna drink that meat with, air?\" Sure enough, I look down and they actually forgot to get anything to drink! As soon as I thought at them, \"maybe a little bit of water would help y'all some,\" another one yelled back \"Air? Bitch it's called water.\" Fucking LOOOOOL I held back my urge to laugh, and I watched in amusement as they scrambled among themselves to figure out what to get to drink until finally the one that thought they were drinking air waddled over to the cold Cokes and heaved a couple of 12 packs \"for good measure\".

Some of the parents that come in and buy stuff for their kids really do be out there being money slaves to their every whims like try keeping that up in their teens and young adult lives see how that works out for you. My guess is those kids would end up working at a grocery store run by some middle eastern middle aged men that have an authoritarian grasp over every aspect of how the store operates, to the point where they would remind you about an item you undercharged for two days because It'S iMpOrTaNt FoR mAiNtAiNiNg ThE pRoFiT mArGin.

Nothing out of the ordinary, except for the fact that my man wasn't \"attended like he should be\" and without him and his tiny purchase we don't get money to get paid 🙄🙄😂 okay friend. All of this at 6:30 in the fucking am just because my coworker didn't go out of her way to find another pack of coffee cups just for him since the ones he was forcing out of the cup holder kept ripping (this ding dong didn't realize that you can also get the cups from behind where they don't get damaged).

This motherfucker, Luisito, is an old, bald, arrogant, demanding, narcissistic sleaze, and every time he's in the store, everybody's cortisol level rises. Normally, I don't mind him doing his thing, but today Mr. Luisito decided it would be a good idea to not only interrupt me while I was trying to handle 3 different tasks at the same, but to do so while coming from behind me and snatching the pen I was using right out of my hand. THIS BITCH OOHHHHMAHHGAWD I fucking lost it. Normally, I'm a gentle giant, but today I went corporate on his ass. I snatched that pen right out of his hand and I told him straight up that if he wants something he has to wait his god damned turn. I don't know if I overdid it (according to my coworker, she'd never seen me be that visibly angry before), or if apart from all those adjectives I used to describe him he's also a lil bitch (probably definitely, yes), but boyyyyy this man changed his tune so quick. He started yes manning me for the remainder of the time he was in the store, and behaved pretty nicely after that. Man, my blood still boils thinking about this man, ugh SUBJECT CHANGE!</p>\n<p>Ok, so funny moment flashback. This didn't happen today, it actually happened a few weeks ago, but it's worth mentioning here. Imagine it's March 20, 2020; the coronavirus pandemic is just barely a week old, and grocery stores have been sacked down to the offbrands of the offbrands. This hardy fucking store pulled through (BIG big props to our managers for working through that, I genuinely hope they've recovered from those tumultuous couple of weeks), but recovery wasn't obvious at the time. Now, imagine for a second that you're a dummy idiot and believe that the world's toilet paper supply would never recover from the scare, so you bought the giant $45 rolls that the store had (and still has) available. I would imagine you'd be livid to find out that the good brands of toilet paper slowly came back into circulation 3 weeks later, and now you're stuck with at least a year's worth of shitty toilet paper lmaoo.</p>\n<p>Well, this one Karen thought it would be a great idea to come back with one of those rolls and demand a refund for one of those giant packs. BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH There was a limit at the time of 1 of the little packs inside the giant pack at the time, and the managers HAD to have made a personal exception for her to buy the giant roll. That was the easiest professional \"fuck off\"'s I've ever seen been dealt to someone, and despite her persistence, our manager didn't yield and she left with her giant pack in shame. I swear, I expect the worst from people, and I'm somehow still surprised at how low and shameless some people are willing to go to have their way. The vibe in the air after she left defeated was cathartic; call it a post-nut clarity if you will.</p>\n<p>Finally, the basket holder's back in the tripping spot again yaaaay… We still got 2 baskets in this ho so fuck 'em up fam.</p>"},{"date":"5/29/2020 22:39:17","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"I've made software more complex than Boss Man's personality lol","link":"https://giphy.com/gifs/fB938PbR1ulsA/html5`video/mp4","content":"<p>Imagine walking up to Boss Man to start the day and you see THAT^^. I kind of already suspected what was going on, but it didn't take much (actually, I just kinda stood there) and he immediately just straight up told me he's sick and tired of babysitting Chief.com. Feelsbadman for him and Chief.com, but at the same time, this kid really do be out here hiding for hours at a time like………… just stay home if you're gonna fuck around. You wanna fuck around and be paid, you gotta get white collar job boy, JUST sayin'. To Chief.com's credit, he DID make a valuable contribution today: he made me figure out how many minutes there are in October lmaoo. Like, it's an easy calculation, but not the kind of thing you'd expect from Chief.com and friends. Good shit Chief.com, you go Chief.com!</p>\n<p>Grape Man joined the party today! He got his dinner of two 6 packs of cheap beer, but he surprisingly didn't ask for 99¢ cigs. Instead, he walked up to my register and said he was sorry for what he said last time -- that he didn't mean the things he said about Big Boss's daughter. Honestly, I didn't know what the hell he was talking about for about 3 sentences, until he mentioned that he was just \"blowing smoke up her ass\". LMAOOO Well, that's a sentence I never expected to hear from Grape Man, not because it's original or out of context. He's just usually not that cool about social situations; usually he's balls deep about some deep state conspiracy theory he saw on the YouTubes. Grape Man, if you have somehow through your own wit stumbled on this post, you're a beautiful human being in your own way, take a shower more often (I don't have the cojones to tell you in person), and what you got going on is, quite literally, something worth studying in depth. They say keep Austin weird, and you singlehandedly keep Texas weird my guy ;)</p>\n<p>Today a group of 3 musketeers showed up to buy a 24 pack of beer -- the over 21 guy, the money guy, and the wingman. Nothing seemed to be going out of the ordinary, until it was time to pay. I asked for ID, and after over 21 guy showed his 1996 birthday or whatever, money guy pulled out a gift debit card. He does the card payment procedure, hears the beep, and then stares visibly confused at the screen. He knows the transaction didn't go through, and I tell him the card only paid for $6. I shit you not, this motherfucker starts going all Zach Galifianakis math meme on me, and then he starts laughing. He tells his bros his bitch of a girlfriend owes him $24 cuz he knew that hoe had money in it before he got it today. BRUHHHHHHHH I've only ever seen that kind of shortage analysis from Boss Man, but this dum-knuck lookin ass out here figuring out why he's short and laughing about it with the bros had me all kinds of laughing like wow, what a bitch to take your money bro :P He ended up paying with cash, but when the little receipt came up with the big bold $6 he paid, he was like \"Yeah, lemme show her that\" and he fucking took the little paper too. I was fucking dead after that I swear.</p>\n<p>The year is 20XX. Coronavirus has killed 99% of boomers, and the store still hasn't obtained handheld baskets. +1 to my bro Kintsu for moving the goD dammned basket holder to where it doesn't trip people &lt;3.</p>\n<p>What a fucken day.</p>"},{"date":"5/28/2020 15:28:30","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"Some days, you go in wearing your shirt backward, and that's ok.","link":"https://giphy.com/gifs/CQhvppGGlxgA0`video/mp4","content":"<p>Aaaaand the basket holder is right back in its tripping area as scheduled, so fuck me for trying to prevent people from falling over c: We still got the same 2 lone baskets, so who knows how much longer until the last little one is taken…. low key I kinda want to see what will happen when they inevitably disappear.</p>\n<p>I wore my shirt backward for the first 5 hours of work today, so that was something hilarious to have pointed out to me (thank you, kind old lady). Morning shifts tend to have much fewer crackheads and crazy people, so today wasn't anything extremely out of the ordinary. Probably the worst bit was that I fucked up a classic Lone-Star/cash transaction. I left this poor lady without food stamps for the rest of her month because I forgot that our shitty POS software ignores cash payments that are registered first.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I got to hear Boss Man call his favorite employee a dumbass.

Today he came in and bought his usual 1-2 of beer and 99¢ cigarettes, and kept his tinfoil hat commentary to a minimum, but the funniest bit today for him was his commentary on me and the Big Boss's daughter. She made the usual play where she pretends to be related to me, and he fell just like everybody else, but what he did different is that he started making an in-depth analysis about our different power levels of work. According to him, she is 15% more potent than me at the job. Good shit, Grape man, good shit…</p>\n<p>Personally for me, the highlight of the day was making an Excel template for the smaller sheets of stickers that we have available for price tags. I got to chill by the computer and burn close to an hour working with that, so that was nice. I probably burned through 30 sheets of paper to get it just right, but it's for science so fuck 'em up fam. What I really wish is that I could dedicate my full time to working on item pricing, and creating a more streamlined way of handling the ever-changing prices on items all around the store. However, there's other priorities right now, like telling one of your bigger regular clients to fuck off (good job with that one, Big Boss). Granted, I did hear him telling his daughter that the client had lied and was definitely in the wrong, so assuming that's the case, it's refreshing to see that bickering doesn't always work for clients. It's defintely off-putting to get stuck in the middle of those discussions though, but what can I say other than it's what makes the ins and outs of the day that much more interesting.</p>\n<p>Finally, today officially marks another day without new handheld baskets. I tried to move the basket container once again to a spot where it won't trip people over. Hopefully with the new placement, the morning shift people will leave it be and it will inspire management to give these baskets a bit more priority….. pfffffft LOL.</p>\n<p>That's all folks!</p>"},{"date":"5/25/2020 22:10:43","username":"tacowhisperer","title":"What even happened today?","link":"https://gfycat.com/sarcasticeducatedjohndory`video/mp4","content":"<p>There seemed to be a couple of high surges in people today, especially around the 2-4pm hour block. Lots of fajita and marinaded selections, probably the extra bits left over from all them food stamps the government handed out this month (God bless America).

It went broke, and was bought by The Men - Boss the Father, Big Boss, Medium Boss, and Boss Man. And they reworked it into a 99¢ store. And on the 10th year, they expanded to the Food City a couple of streets down. And they reworked it into a supermarket. And from their intense managerial technique, they spawned the Militant Man, he who executes commands in parallel across the realm, and shuts the whole thing down early on Sundays because fuck that shit we gonna have a good Sunday night.</p>\n<p>Let us pray.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Our Boss Men, who art in business, hallowed be thy wholesale.

You might have had to scroll for a while to get to this post, so congratulations on making it to the end (or I should say beginning). This is the place where I record the shenanigans happening at a family-owned supermarket in a small suburb of Texas. You won't be able to hear a thing walking into the store since the fans will grind your eardrums to a pulp, but here you will read about the best tales of all the crackheads that walk in, the fist fights that emerge between the grandmas, drunks, punks, and skanks, the stream of Karens and shit-for-brains that walk through those beautiful, totally functional doors, and even all the wholesome stuff too (hey, it's not all bad).</p>\n<p>You may find some of the earlier posts to be a bit more ranty and foul mouthed than later posts since the initial purpose of the blog was to have a venting space (*update* turns out that my foul mouth just can't stop, oh well 🙄). Eventually, the voice and tone for the contents here smooth out into something a bit more relatable for those not directly working in the store, but it's all here in its least doxxing form for your entertainment, so please enjoy. Who knows for how long this will keep going, and I definitely cannot guarantee a daily entry since life does tend to get in the way, but do stop by whenever you feel like reading up on some poor man's little corner of the world in a supermarket store.</p>\n<p>To kick things off, today officially marks the first day that both the morning cashiers and the afternoon cashiers know that there are only 2 more hand baskets left for the entire store. Maybe someone will finally realize that the basket holder that trips everyone over should be taken out before someone gets injured, but I actually predict that people will just keep asking for baskets until one day our only choice will be to tell them that this place doesn't have handheld baskets, and that they should have thought about how stupid they must feel for asking before daring to ask for a small and reasonable accomodation from our overlords…. errr.. managers (if you're reading this and you're a manager at this store, much love and praise and respec &lt;3).</p>"}],"usernameContent":{"tacowhisperer":{"display":"(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻","ppic":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/389773262/1470411492/600x200","bio":"Quarter of my life gone by and got nothing to show for it :)","link":"https://github.com/tacowhisperer","bday":"October 10, 1994"}}}
