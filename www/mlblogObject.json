                        "content": "When I first arrived at this job, all I saw were mountains and mountains of hamburger bread just waiting to be packed. I just couldn't believe that _that much freaking cheap hamburger bread_ moved through the store, especially since I would often pack some only to have the shelf be overstuffed and old, moldy hamburger bread would stay hidden in the back of the bottom shelf. Now, not only does 45 trays of bread seem like too little, this kind of hamburger bread delivery has to be done 3 times a week because it sells out in about a day and a half. This amounts to a total of about 120-135 trays of hamburger bread (that's 2400-2700 individual hamburger buns) a week! Forget the meat man, IS HAMBERDER BREAD TIME.\n\nI was relunctant to share, but I oficially have a sugar mamma. This woman, God bless her heart, gives me $7 to $10 almost every week just because I remind her of her son, and she refuses my refusals every time. I feel like a lab rat now, because every time I see her, I've been conditioned to go into money receival mode lol To date, she has given me somewhere on the order of $50, but what she doesn't know is that I plan on giving it all back in some way that I'm still working out. Hopefully I can make this happen before the schedule shifts and I no longer get to see her regularly ü§ûü§û You saw it here first, folks.\n\nIn other random news, yesterday I found someone's SD card, along with a hair salon business card and some woman named Flor's phone number inside a plastic baggie. I didn't write about it in yesterday's blog entry because I was mostly busy doing boring old chores and other miscellaneous tasks, but toward the end of the day, I plugged the card into my laptop and I found photo sessions of the biggest pair of tiddies I have ever had the privilege to place my eyes on.\n\nSike.\n\nIt had photos going on 8+ years of age from someone that goes to the Catholic church down the road from where I live, and I recognized someone from one of the photos, so I went detective mode trying to figure out how to get that woman's phone number, and I ran across someone else from the church that happened to have her phone number, so now that SD card is back on track to its owner üëç Someone remind me to implement a PAT AUTHOR ON THE BACK button, because I need external recognition of my achievements to feel alive.\n\nQUANTUM <-- Guess who dropped that one today. He also ordered 5 today, and plans on traveling to the past once he masters quantum.\n\nSo, Big Boss is on a Big Mission to get a gas station up and running, and he has taken the initiative of feeding the construction workers food from the store, on the house, so that's nice of him. However, the man himself has gotten very noticeably tan, and today I pointed that out to him. He said \"me voy a poner tanga para que salga bien el tan\" üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ Caught me off guard with that one LMAOOO God bless this man and his fuck-you-I-do-what-I-want personality.\n\nOn a morning shift like today, once 1pm rolls around, time seems to hit _sonic speed_ cuz the anticipation of getting out and the sudden surge of people trying to get their fix of lunch/dinner for later speeds things up from whatever they were earlier in the day. I checked out my last customer like I would any other, fast as fuck boy, and I was getting ready to put out my report to go turn in my register, but an older gentleman had left some stuff on my register, and it was only a couple of things, so I decided to check him out since it was whatever.\n\nWell, I was fucking WRONG. Not only did he take his sweet ass time pulling out his wallet, made every mistake possible when paying with Lone Star and debit, but he was very very drunk too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When I say every mistake, I mean every single mistake that customers do on a regular basis.\n\n1. He was swiping the magnetic strip the wrong way on the Lone Star\n2. He pressed debit instead of EBT-Food once he got the swipe right\n3. He entered the wrong PIN once he got EBT-Food right\n4. He delayed taking out other forms of payment when I explained to him that EBT doesn't cover Taqueria\n5. He had to enter the chip on his debit card 3 times and swipe, only to have the wrong PIN on that one too\n\nThere was more things that he fucked up, but as you might imagine, at this point, the man has been in line for like 10 minutes to do a 1-2 minute transaction. So, I took his card and just did everything for him, and I finally got to leave and take a sweet, well earned nap."

                        "content": "Forget today, I didn't go to the store anyway and no one else wants to write for the blog, so we're doing a flashback today! Today's flashback edition: near death instances.\n\nWhile a lot of professionally run businesses divert their profits back into their companies for quality of life improvement and expansion, this little puppy right here has the bare minimum of that. You don't have to look very far to see old, tattered equipment _still in use_ from 20 years ago. In fact, I believe that their parking lot hasn't been redone since The Men bought the damn thing, but the equipment in question is the cash registers. It's very obvious that they've taken a hard beating for at least the past decade, and quite possibly for longer since no one is either knowledgeable enough or caring enough to try and fix some of the bigger mechanical or digital issues with the registers. For example, all registers claim to have Apple Pay, but it's a coin toss whether or not the thing is working, and it's impossible to explain to someone that has no knowledge of how the system works that if the card reader doesn't have green dots, it's not working (if you know what I'm talking about, you know, and if you don't, my point is proven). Or worse, register 2's hood isn't fixed in place by screws or anything, only by a single corner that properly slides into a small crevice in the register frame. What this means is that it often violently falls on the floor, and more often than not, there are children or elderly people right where it can damage their feet or what have you. A more seemingly innocent issue with the registers is that they will periodically stop scanning/weighing items. For the longest time, I assumed that these problems were easily fixable by resetting the scanner. I had done it a dozen times up until this point, and when Kintsu's register presented the problem, I felt confident that I could fix it for him and get things running again. I confidently told him to step aside and let a professional handle it, and as I reached into the wiring of the register to unplug the scanner to reset it, I ended up touching a conduit pipe and...\n\nGUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nI felt a big electric shock across the span of my arms and chest, and after at least a quarter of a second, I finally reacted to let go of the damn thing. I was very literally in shock, and I could still feel the electric disturbance in my chest near my heart üòÄ Up until that point in my life, I've had maybe 1 or 2 close calls with live wires, but this one came the fuck out of nowhere. Maybe it's my lack of electrical knowledge, but one would assume that something that has to be manhandled frequently like a register at a store wouldn't have fucking electrically charged covered wires, but not here, no sir. I took a couple of minutes to reflect on what had just happened because I needed to retrace why I had gotten shocked so bad, and then I finally realized it's most likely because someone taped wires together inside the pipe and there was contact where there shouldn't be, and because I was holding onto the metal hood with my left arm while I was poking around with my right and I set myself up for that nasty ground discharge path. I got the sweats afterward, as one naturally does with a near death experience, but at least in my case, if that had been it for me, at least I would have died satisfied, knowing that I've done what I can and what I've wanted to within my moral and financial constraints.\n\nA second, non personally near death experience but definitely a hazardous one, was the time that the AC unit in the ceiling fell in the middle of rush hour with people walking around because the people in charge of installing it didn't properly secure it before removing the supporting structure while trying to change it out. Now THAT was a shitshow, both because when it fell, it didn't fall all the way to the floor (it got held up by the tortilla shelf and a corner of the ceiling tile), and customers weren't securing their children from walking under or near it while it was very possibly hanging on by something that wasn't designed to hold 200+ pounds of equipment and could have definitely taken the final plunge to the floor. After a couple of hours of watching frantic workers try and carefully lower it to the ground and breathing possibly asbestos since the pink fluffy insulation in the ceiling hasn't been changed since the store was bought because why would it, the situation was finally put under control and thankfully no one was injured.\n\n[Also, this happened here not super long ago](https://www.facebook.com/KPRC2/videos/south-houston-police-are-searching-for-at-least-four-robbers-they-say-overpowere/973342189526937/).\n\nImagine the number of near death stories from all other workers that have ever had the privilege to work here might have, jeez."

Instead he makes his money through research.. possibly that means the stock market, but more likely it means some sort of government aid.\n\nAlso, some homeless? crackhead? definitely old man came walking in with a frail, scared looking, skittish dog throughout the store. Neither Big Boss nor anyone really cared to do anything about it, and in fact, Big Boss claimed that his daughter is defintely the reason people bring animals into the store lol. But, according to QtSteel, the man threatened to leave the derpy lookin' lopsided-ear dog at the store üòÇ Poor thing.\n\nI didn't get the main register today, so I saw fewer people, and I didn't get to work on my special price job either since some a-hat at work threw away my price sheet ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI NEED MORE AUTHORS FOR THIS BLOG.

I unplug my phone from the charger, turn off my PC, slap on a face mask, grab my water bottle, and hit the road for another round of involuntary social interactions. God, what a pain to get off the car and walk in through those doors.. I slap on my public figure personality, drag my feet across the parking lot, and rush to my timesheet to clock in once more. It's not even the coronavirus that has me exhausted; it's the stagnation of a bunch of shitty, albeit could be worse, circumstances and events outside of my control that got me stuck swimming in molasses to move forward with my life.\n\nThen in comes the world renown Grape Man. Holy shit, the man, the myth, the legend. This man is pure gold, and he doesn't even know it. I'm at my register contemplating my existence, and this guy comes to the register behind me, and he doesn't say hi. No. He doesn't even address the current social context, weather, nor his 99¬¢ cigarettes. The very first words that come out of his mouth today -- IN RUSSIA ü§£üòÇü§£ He obviously couldn't see because of the mask, but I was already cracking up because it's gonna be good.\n\n\"In Russia, the only place that requires face masks is McDonald's\"\n\nNever change, Grape Man, never change. Do shower though, today you were specially smelly.\n\nAfter having my mind cleared from that interaction, I was officially in the game -- I was warmed up and dispatching customers lightning mcfast. Sometimes, I go so fast that customers aren't ready to pay when I tell them the total. Like, they stare at me wondering why I'm telling them a number (their total). This one middle aged woman though was wayyyy in lala land though. I told her her total, and not only did she struggle to figure out that I was finished; when she realized that she had to pay, she took out a $20 bill and tried to stick it into the card reader ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ Even she realized how dumb that was, because she started laughing and laughing and honestly, it was contagious like coronavirus c;\n\nUsually, most of the time that I walk into the restroom and find some rando in there, interactions are awkward, and most of the time they walk out without washing their hands... WHY WHY WHY EWW. Today though, this numnuck stoopid ass perv walked into the restroom while I was using a urinal, and stood right behind me a couple of feet right where I could see him and he could see me. I turned around and made eye contact with him and he just stood there dumbfounded........ I was so shocked that someone could be so fucking stupid and not realize how invasive they're being that I didn't tell him anything. In no scenario today did I imagine that I would have to tell a grown ass man that he shouldn't stand right behind me while I'm trying to pee, wow. When I finished, he told me to \"Go ahead\" and I was thiiiiiis close to asking him why he stood there watching me take a leak. Damn. Like, this is definitely tmi so look away now you've been warned..... ... ... ... ok, so like, I'm not pee shy, which is especially helpful with the cramped ass restroom at work, but I almost felt my feed cut off from being so weirded out by the guy just standing there behind me lmao. I've said it before and I'll say it again -- these people are bots, prove me wrong ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Missed an opportunity to urinate on a grown man today. Never thought I'd tick that box off while being 100% sober.\n\nThe afternoon after that fiasco was pretty standard though. Bimbo man came in and brought ants on one of his boxes and Boss Man went full üî®üî®üî®üî®üî®üî® ball buster mode on him and made me get Raid to spray on the bread to kill the ants lol And then a lady was buying hamburger supplies, and bought a pickle jar that I made the mistake of giving to a small child to carry (the child broke the jar, surprise surprise). After being showered by the pickle juice, I offered her the chance to go get another one while I cleaned up the mess, so she had her older daughter go get another jar. Then she wanted to pay with food stamps, but needed for me to type in the numbers manually since here magnetic stripe doesn't work. I don't have any issue with typing in numbers or anything like that, but I still don't know how to do that, and when I informed her of this, she told her little children that they were going to another store because \"they don't want to type in the numbers for me here\". This bitch, after all the work I went to replacing her broken pickle jar too, wowww. Maybe it's the tone of voice I said it in, but whatever.\n\nBoss Man ended the day by angrily telling some random man that had a stroke or something to go buy his dick cream and leave."

Usually, üî• days like these only happen with Militant Man, but this system is chaotic and entirely dependent on Boss Man's mood for the morning. Today, the mood was \"Why are there more cashiers than carniceros right now.\" Same, Boss Man, same.\n\nSo, I spend the majority of the morning and some of the midday hopping up and down the store getting pedidos ready to go (according to Pok√©mon Go, I walked 5 miles today, go figure), but today I got Mr. Luisito's order. It didn't seem so bad, just the usual weird shit he always buys like this VERY SPECIFIC BRAND OF SMOOTH PLATES OHMYGOD IF IT'S NOT THIS BRAND I WANT NOTHING, and caldo veggies. Except, that in my mind's eye, I didn't think that when the pedido said \"3 cabbage\", they meant 3 boxes of cabbage, so I just got this baldy 3 heads of cabbage and called it done. I fucking wish I was up front for this, it sounds like it would have been hilarious to watch from afar, but apparently, he made such a big god damned shitshow that his order WASN'T COMPLETE WHO THE FUCK DID THIS ORDER AHHHHH that even the taqueria ladies in the kitchen in the back were telling me about it LMAO. Jesus fuck now that's the Luisito I know. Fuck this man, but at the same time it's funny how stirred up he gets over minor details and very easily fixable problems........... just like Boss Man.\n\nI also worked on a pedido for La Morenita; ezpz stuff and very straightforward to complete. Today, after the transaction was all said and done, it was time to load it up to their delivery man's truck, and it was just me and Chief.com to get that done. I would say that we both did about equal parts work getting it loaded in, but when their delivery guy came up to tip, he passed the money in front of Chief.com's face and said told me \"Here you go, thanks.\" UHHHHH lol I didn't want to be a dick and keep it all, so I gave Chief.com 30%, but shit man people really do be clear cut on how they perceive work gets done. Apparently, I have a very \"hard working demeanor\", but really I just think it's the light skin ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.\n\nFinally, Cash King came in today with half his face swollen from being in a fist fight.

As I imagined, the alarm clock this morning was just pure pain, like waking up for an 8am for college, but literally way fucking worse because it's out of necessity. And yet, somehow, there are people that see the doors open before 6am and just decide to start their day grocery shopping ü§Æ Literally not even 10 minutes into opening, a crackhead couple walked into the store. Usually, when crackheads walk in bright and early in the morning, it means that they've been out and about and are looking for a quick fix of cigarettes or beer or something before moving on. This time though, these people got themselves a cart and started shopping around. In my time working here, I've only seen a handful of people that go 30+ minutes walking about shopping comparing prices and generally just taking their sweet time getting their errand done. No one batted an eye at this couple until 30, 40, 50 minutes went by and they were still walking around the store looking through item after item. After all the red flags had been raised, Militant Man went full, well, militant mode, just letting everyone know to keep an eye out for any funny business conducted by these people. I watched from afar how they went shelf by shelf, item by item, but neither of them had large bags or deep pockets to keep anything in, so I was just completely baffled, but mostly entertained by the prospect that someone would come in and first thing in the morning sack the store, especially before 6am.\n\nAfter the first morning rush of people trying to get their daily fix of coffee, I decided to go sleuthing and see what the deal with them was. I swear, these two were literally just casually shopping and reading the descriptions of every single item that they came across like it was their first time going shopping for themselves. They had a really nice demeanor, and I felt bad for judging them so harshly for their very obvious substance abuse. The real life Carl and Ellie, if you will. For example, the man would say \"Hey babe, come look at this soap. It says to use in HIGH EFFICIENCY machines!\" It really was that innocent of a trip, and I felt like an asshole for the rest of the time they were there. They ended up leaving around 7:30am, so they were easily in there for at least an hour and a half -- that's gotta be a record somewhere for genuine shopping time (they definitely won't beat this one old lady that comes in and takes like 3 hours to buy like 2 bags of cookies and a couple of vegetables and milk... that old lady is QUEEN at taking her sweet ass time, like not even The Men are willingly present that long in their own store lmao).\n\nMy one year anniversary is coming up in 21 days, so woooo...."

So, children are starting to be let into the store by their parents as 'rona becomes older and older news every passing week. Of course, as soon as that thing arrives at the store, everyone is most definitely mega screwed. You see masks down on people everywhere, especially the boss man, but depressing news aside, I find it cute how people start to make kid's sized masks! Like, look at their dumb little faces, so innocent and unjaded... This mom was walking in with 3 of her little girls, and the smallest one didn't have her mask on. For some reason, mamma didn't remember about her face covering until they were inside the store, so she takes out what I would assume is a face mask for herself that she had in her purse and put it on her before they got too far inside. But her face is very obviously too small, and as soon as mom put the thing on her face, it was like she took saran wrap and wrapped her entire face from forehead to chin üòÇüòÇüò≠ Normally, I'd say fuck 'em kids, but the way the little girl stumbled then when mom finally realized what she had done and I just couldn't contain myself.

Grape Man DID comment on a coworker's outfit, so that's something I guess, but nothing else from them.\n\nThis old man came in today and was getting whatever. The thing that caught my attention from him, though, was that this man was casually wearing some toenail clippers on his necklace like he needs to be ready at a moment's notice of a sudden pedicure. For some reason, I found this amusing, but I didn't really ask him any questions. He reminded me of another old man that used to swing by fairly regularly - Quarter Ear Man. He would walk around the store and do everything normally, except that he would have a quarter sticking out from either ear.....\n\nRight toward the end of the shift, I had to charge a cartfull of random stuff for these 3 super round ladies. I'm no health guru, but I've spent well over a year working on changing my body so I've learned a thing or two about food nutrition, and by working here for the past 11 months at the time of this writing, I've definitely noticed that the quantity and proportion of sugary and fatty foods that people buy are directly proportional to their apparent body mass index. In layman's terms, fat people buy hella junk food, and these 3 ladies were no exception to this observation -- Bimbo, sandwich supplies, sweet bread, candy, cooking oil, every cheese imaginable, etc..\n\nOnce I was done charging their loot, the main one hollers at the other two \"Hey, y'all forgot to get the drinks. What are y'all gonna drink that meat with, air?\" Sure enough, I look down and they actually forgot to get anything to drink! As soon as I thought at them, \"maybe a little bit of water would help y'all some,\" another one yelled back \"Air? Bitch it's called water.\" Fucking LOOOOOL I held back my urge to laugh, and I watched in amusement as they scrambled among themselves to figure out what to get to drink until finally the one that thought they were drinking air waddled over to the cold Cokes and heaved a couple of 12 packs \"for good measure\". They paid with Lone Star, a classic move with cartfulls of junkfood (God bless poverty and the sugar that keeps it afloat), and finally went on their merry way.\n\nThis morning Militant Man has officially confirmed that the store will be opening at 5:30am. It makes sense because it's very rushed to try and get coffee done before swarms of people start walking in but fuuUuuUUuuUUuuuUUUUUuuUuuuck"

He's a respectable man; he always comes with his best boots and belt, and always pulls out nice THICK wads of unordered cash to pay for his tripas, chuck roll, pastor, you name it, hence the nickname. Something about his personality or his physical features (definitely both) rub off on you as him being a hard working, but also very personable man. So this very well shaped lady walks by while he's paying me, and he knows that I know that he knows that we know that that was some fiiiiiiiine booty walking by. This man pauses his cash counting, closes his eyes, and does a little sign of the cross, and then keeps on counting cash like the fucking king that he is LOOOOOOOOL God damn, that's a level of ass admiration that I've never seen anywhere else before üëèüëèüëè I just can't believe I forgot entirely about this when I wrote my blog entry yesterday. Better late than never!\n\nToday's main superstar was gone - Kintsu you piece of shit, I love you bro, and it hurts when you're gone ;c Of all days to miss work, you chose payday you dum dum it better have been a good fucking reason. It wouldn't have been such a big deal though, if it weren't that Big Boss's daughter was also absent lmao. When we needed y'all most, you vanished! The show went on though, so mad props to QtSteel for pulling that bread through and me for knowing how to make up prices for big list items like the big genius that I am.\n\nBut enough about me and my big, sexy brain (that totally doesn't make mistakes ever). Instead, let's talk about this fucking lil fatty bitch of a 10-12 year old girl that started crying because her mommy didn't buy her Cheetos Funyuns. Holy moly. I'm not a parent yet, so take my words with a pound of salt, but there's undeniably an age cutoff for when kids should stop making spectacles out in public. Lord, if that were my kid I would beat that shit out of her so fast she never knew what hit her. I'm kidding of course, but I definitely wouldn't let that kind of behavior grow out of hand. Some of the parents that come in and buy stuff for their kids really do be out there being money slaves to their every whims like try keeping that up in their teens and young adult lives see how that works out for you. My guess is those kids would end up working at a grocery store run by some middle eastern middle aged men that have an authoritarian grasp over every aspect of how the store operates, to the point where they would remind you about an item you undercharged for two days because It'S iMpOrTaNt FoR mAiNtAiNiNg ThE pRoFiT mArGin. Bruh, a single (key word here SINGLE, as in 1 time) 60¬¢ loss on an item ain't gonna ruin the store, buddy. Still kinda salty about that one üò§üò§üò§\n\nANYWAY, Big Boss almost hit this dude with his truck. What a Big Boss thing for him to do ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Poor guy was mad at him, and for good reason, but good luck fighting the man that controls the entire suburb. He got the police department eating out of the palm of his hand BOY. This guy went to school with QtSteel, so she knows his name and personal details, but what she doesn't know that I know about him is where he lives (saw him walking out of his house on a trip to find stolen carts for Boss Man), and that he asked for Eevee's whereabouts one time around Thanksgiving/Christmas.\n\nüåàthe more you knowüåàüåü"

The paletero brought her a mangonada specially for her, and she had left it in the cooler all day to take. She was fixing to walk away, and she tells me \"Hopefully the paletero didn't put any love potion in it cuz it ain't gonna work on me\". For some reason, I found that hilarious and random as fuck, so I played along and asked her \"Why, he's a good working man and full of nothing but sweetness\" and she responded \"Well, it's for my son, so if anyone's gonna be falling for him it's gonna be him\". Anyway, that was hilarious. To think that she was at one point my least favorite coworker too. You live and you learn I guess!\n\nUmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, no crackheads today, baskets still suck, these riots and lootings be getting crazy, 2020 really be out here one upping itself every day, stonks only go up, okay I'm done."

Still has that crazy stink eye like always, and her manner of walking and talking still make it feel like she's gonna fall over and break her skull, but she certainly stopped coming over like she used to on the daily for her \"ChEaP 3 dOlLaR cIgArEtTeS\".\n\nFeelsbadman for the manager today: he tries so hard to be healthy and follow what I can only imagine is his doctor/wife's diet plan, but his little maneuver today is just priceless. He came to my register to pay for a 7-UP and some Funyuns, a classic move when he's got the munchies on the triple. I don't judge. In fact, I feel bad for him because I know just how badly he wants to stop being overweight. But anyways, I had noticed a little disposible tray in the register behind me, and usually that area is reserved for the managers when they're snacking. I didn't think much of it, until I had nothing going on for a brief couple of minutes. I opened up the container and found a fork and a few cactus bits in there. This man gave up eating the cactuses and got himself those Funyuns lmaooo Fucking same. Well, that, or he tried to cancel out his sinful food with some healthy stuff. Either way, it sucks that healthy food just doesn't taste that great, but what can I say other than the struggle is real."

Good for the store, bad for the back (I definitely strained my disks today, yikes....). This morning came in this pretty little princess of a man and his hog of a wife. Nothing out of the ordinary, except for the fact that my man wasn't \"attended like he should be\" and without him and his tiny purchase we don't get to get paid -_-. All of this at 6:30 in the fucking am just because my coworker didn't go out of her way to find another pack of coffee cups just for him since the ones he was forcing out of the cup holder kept ripping (this ding dong didn't realize that you can also get the cups from behind where they don't get damaged). Personally, I would have gotten him and his mistress their cups for coffee since it's whatever, but the man literally stayed quiet when I asked him how I could help and instead chose to keep on ranting and ranting and ranting. Jesus fuck, these people are literally bots -- prove me wrong. I accidentally made my coworker laugh for dismissing him as a lost case before he was out of earshot, and he turned around and yelled \"Go ahead and laugh at me, you clowns\". looool Outside the daily 1 or 2 frisky clients that want to make a giant fucking scandal out of the tiniest issues, everything seemed to be going about as smoothly as it could.\n\nThen came in this omega asshole. This motherfucker, Luisito, is an old, bald, arrogant, demanding, narcissistic sleaze, and every time he's in the store, everybody's cortisol level rises. Normally, I don't mind him doing his thing, but today Mr. Luisito decided it would be a good idea to not only interrupt me while I was trying to handle 3 different tasks at the same, but to do so while coming from behind me and snatching the pen I was using right out of my hand. THIS BITCH OOHHHHMAHHGAWD I fucking lost it. Normally, I'm a gentle giant, but today I went corporate on his ass. I snatched that pen right out of his hand and I told him straight up that if he wants something he has to wait his god damned turn. I don't know if I overdid it (according to my coworker, she'd never seen me be that visibly angry before), or if apart from all those adjectives I used to describe him he's also a lil bitch (probably definitely, yes), but boyyyyy this man changed his tune so quick. He started yes manning me for the remainder of the time he was in the store, and behaved pretty nicely after that. Man, my blood still boils thinking about this man, ugh SUBJECT CHANGE!\n\nOk, so funny moment flashback. This didn't happen today, it actually happened a few weeks ago, but it's worth mentioning here. Imagine it's March 20, 2020; the coronavirus pandemic is just barely a week old, and grocery stores have been sacked down to the offbrands of the offbrands. This hardy fucking store pulled through (BIG big props to our managers for working through that, I genuinely hope they've recovered from those tumultuous couple of weeks), but recovery wasn't obvious at the time. Now, imagine for a second that you're a dummy idiot and believe that the world's toilet paper supply would never recover from the scare, so you bought the giant $45 rolls that Mexico Lindo had (and still has) available. I would imagine you'd be livid to find out that the good brands of toilet paper slowly came back into circulation 3 weeks later, and now you're stuck with at least a year's worth of shitty toilet paper lmaoo.\n\nWell, this one Karen thought it would be a great idea to come back with one of those rolls and demand a refund for one of those giant packs. BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH There was a limit at the time of 1 of the little packs inside the giant pack at the time, and the managers HAD to have made a personal exception for her to buy the giant roll. That was the easiest professional \"fuck off\"'s I've ever seen been dealt to someone, and despite her persistence, our manager didn't yield and she left with her giant pack in shame. I swear, I expect the worst from people, and I'm somehow still surprised at how low and shameless some people are willing to go to have their way. The vibe in the air after she left defeated was cathartic; call it a post-nut clarity if you will.\n\nFinally, the basket holder's back in the tripping spot again yaaaay... We still got 2 baskets in this ho so fuck 'em up fam."

Feelsbadman for him and Chief.com, but at the same time, this kid really do be out here hiding for hours at a time like............ just stay home if you're gonna fuck around. You wanna fuck around and be paid, you gotta get white collar job boy, JUST sayin'. To Chief.com's credit, he DID make a valuable contribution today: he made me figure out how many minutes there are in October lmaoo. Like, it's an easy calculation, but not the kind of thing you'd expect from Chief.com and friends. Good shit Chief.com, you go Chief.com!\n\nGrape Man joined the party today! He got his dinner of two 6 packs of cheap beer, but he surprisingly didn't ask for 99¬¢ cigs. Instead, he walked up to my register and said he was sorry for what he said last time -- that he didn't mean the things he said about Big Boss's daughter. Honestly, I didn't know what the hell he was talking about for about 3 sentences, until he mentioned that he was just \"blowing smoke up her ass\". LMAOOO Well, that's a sentence I never expected to hear from Grape Man, not because it's original or out of context. He's just usually not that cool about social situations; usually he's balls deep about some deep state conspiracy theory he saw on the YouTubes. Grape Man, if you have somehow through your own wit stumbled on this post, you're a beautiful human being in your own way, take a shower more often (I don't have the cojones to tell you in person), and what you got going on is, quite literally, something worth studying in depth. They say keep Austin weird, and you singlehandedly keep Texas weird my guy ;)\n\nToday a group of 3 musketeers showed up to buy a 24 pack of beer -- the over 21 guy, the money guy, and the wingman. Nothing seemed to be going out of the ordinary, until it was time to pay. I asked for ID, and after over 21 guy showed his 1996 birthday or wuteva, money guy pulled out a gift debit card. He does the card payment procedure, hears the beep, and then stares visibly confused at the screen. He knows the transaction didn't go through, and I tell him the card only paid for $6. I shit you not, this motherfucker starts going all Zach Galifianakis math meme on me, and then he starts laughing. He tells his bros his bitch of a girlfriend owes him $24 cuz he knew that hoe had money in it before he got it today. BRUHHHHHHHH I've only ever seen that kind of shortage analysis from Boss Man, but this dum-knuck lookin ass out here figuring out why he's short and laughing about it with the bros had me all kinds of laughing like wow, what a bitch to take your money bro :P He ended up paying with cash, but when the little receipt came up with the big bold $6 he paid, he was like \"Yeah, lemme show her that\" and he fucking took the little paper too. I was fucking dead after that I swear.\n\nThe year is 20XX. Coronavirus has killed 99% of boomers, and Mexico Lindo still hasn't obtained handheld baskets. +1 to my bro Kintsu for moving the goD dammned basket holder to where it doesn't trip people <3.\n\nWhat a fucken day."

Morning shifts tend to have much fewer crackheads and crazy people, so today wasn't anything extremely out of the ordinary.

Today he came in and bought his usual 1-2 of beer and 99¬¢ cigarettes, and kept his tinfoil hat commentary to a minimum, but the funniest bit today for him was his commentary on me and the Big Boss's daughter. She made the usual play where she pretends to be related to me, and he fell just like everybody else, but what he did different is that he started making an in-depth analysis about our different power levels of work. According to him, she is 15% more potent than me at the job. Good shit, Grape man, good shit...\n\nPersonally for me, the highlight of the day was making an Excel template for the smaller sheets of stickers that we have available for price tags. I got to chill by the computer and burn close to an hour working with that, so that was nice. I probably burned through 30 sheets of paper to get it just right, but it's for science so fuck 'em up fam. What I really wish is that I could dedicate my full time to working on item pricing, and creating a more streamlined way of handling the ever-changing prices on items all around the store. However, there's other priorities right now, like telling one of your bigger regular clients to fuck off (good job with that one, Big Boss). Granted, I did hear him telling his daughter that the client had lied and was definitely in the wrong, so assuming that's the case, it's refreshing to see that bickering doesn't always work for clients. It's defintely off-putting to get stuck in the middle of those discussions though, but what can I say other than it's what makes the ins and outs of the day that much more interesting.\n\nFinally, today officially marks another day without new handheld baskets. I tried to move the basket container once again to a spot where it won't trip people over. Hopefully with the new placement, the morning shift people will leave it be and it will inspire management to give these baskets a bit more priority..... pfffffft LOL.\n\nThat's all folks!"

And from their intense managerial technique, they spawned the Militant Man, he who executes commands in parallel across the realm, and shuts the whole thing down early on Sundays because fuck that shit we gonna have a good Sunday night.\n\nOur Boss Men, who art in business, hallowed be thy wholesale. Thy prices come, thy will be done, on margins as the meat comes packaged. Give us this day our daily hamburger bread, and forgive us our typos, as we go humbly ask for the void card in defeat.

                        "content": "<p>When I first arrived at this job, all I saw were mountains and mountains of hamburger bread just waiting to be packed. I just couldn't believe that <em>that much freaking cheap hamburger bread</em> moved through the store, especially since I would often pack some only to have the shelf be overstuffed and old, moldy hamburger bread would stay hidden in the back of the bottom shelf. Now, not only does 45 trays of bread seem like too little, this kind of hamburger bread delivery has to be done 3 times a week because it sells out in about a day and a half. This amounts to a total of about 120-135 trays of hamburger bread (that's 2400-2700 individual hamburger buns) a week! Forget the meat man, IS HAMBERDER BREAD TIME.</p>\n<p>I was relunctant to share, but I oficially have a sugar mamma. This woman, God bless her heart, gives me $7 to $10 almost every week just because I remind her of her son, and she refuses my refusals every time. I feel like a lab rat now, because every time I see her, I've been conditioned to go into money receival mode lol To date, she has given me somewhere on the order of $50, but what she doesn't know is that I plan on giving it all back in some way that I'm still working out. Hopefully I can make this happen before the schedule shifts and I no longer get to see her regularly ü§ûü§û You saw it here first, folks.</p>\n<p>In other random news, yesterday I found someone's SD card, along with a hair salon business card and some woman named Flor's phone number inside a plastic baggie. I didn't write about it in yesterday's blog entry because I was mostly busy doing boring old chores and other miscellaneous tasks, but toward the end of the day, I plugged the card into my laptop and I found photo sessions of the biggest pair of tiddies I have ever had the privilege to place my eyes on.</p>\n<p>Sike.</p>\n<p>It had photos going on 8+ years of age from someone that goes to the Catholic church down the road from where I live, and I recognized someone from one of the photos, so I went detective mode trying to figure out how to get that woman's phone number, and I ran across someone else from the church that happened to have her phone number, so now that SD card is back on track to its owner üëç Someone remind me to implement a PAT AUTHOR ON THE BACK button, because I need external recognition of my achievements to feel alive.</p>\n<p>QUANTUM &lt;-- Guess who dropped that one today. He also ordered 5 today, and plans on traveling to the past once he masters quantum.</p>\n<p>So, Big Boss is on a Big Mission to get a gas station up and running, and he has taken the initiative of feeding the construction workers food from the store, on the house, so that's nice of him. However, the man himself has gotten very noticeably tan, and today I pointed that out to him. He said \"me voy a poner tanga para que salga bien el tan\" üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ Caught me off guard with that one LMAOOO God bless this man and his fuck-you-I-do-what-I-want personality.</p>\n<p>On a morning shift like today, once 1pm rolls around, time seems to hit <em>sonic speed</em> cuz the anticipation of getting out and the sudden surge of people trying to get their fix of lunch/dinner for later speeds things up from whatever they were earlier in the day. I checked out my last customer like I would any other, fast as fuck boy, and I was getting ready to put out my report to go turn in my register, but an older gentleman had left some stuff on my register, and it was only a couple of things, so I decided to check him out since it was whatever.</p>\n<p>Well, I was fucking WRONG. Not only did he take his sweet ass time pulling out his wallet, made every mistake possible when paying with Lone Star and debit, but he was very very drunk too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When I say every mistake, I mean every single mistake that customers do on a regular basis.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He was swiping the magnetic strip the wrong way on the Lone Star</li>\n<li>He pressed debit instead of EBT-Food once he got the swipe right</li>\n<li>He entered the wrong PIN once he got EBT-Food right</li>\n<li>He delayed taking out other forms of payment when I explained to him that EBT doesn't cover Taqueria</li>\n<li>He had to enter the chip on his debit card 3 times and swipe, only to have the wrong PIN on that one too</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There was more things that he fucked up, but as you might imagine, at this point, the man has been in line for like 10 minutes to do a 1-2 minute transaction. So, I took his card and just did everything for him, and I finally got to leave and take a sweet, well earned nap.</p>"

                        "content": "<p>Forget today, I didn't go to the store anyway and no one else wants to write for the blog, so we're doing a flashback today! Today's flashback edition: near death instances.</p>\n<p>While a lot of professionally run businesses divert their profits back into their companies for quality of life improvement and expansion, this little puppy right here has the bare minimum of that. You don't have to look very far to see old, tattered equipment <em>still in use</em> from 20 years ago. In fact, I believe that their parking lot hasn't been redone since The Men bought the damn thing, but the equipment in question is the cash registers. It's very obvious that they've taken a hard beating for at least the past decade, and quite possibly for longer since no one is either knowledgeable enough or caring enough to try and fix some of the bigger mechanical or digital issues with the registers. For example, all registers claim to have Apple Pay, but it's a coin toss whether or not the thing is working, and it's impossible to explain to someone that has no knowledge of how the system works that if the card reader doesn't have green dots, it's not working (if you know what I'm talking about, you know, and if you don't, my point is proven). Or worse, register 2's hood isn't fixed in place by screws or anything, only by a single corner that properly slides into a small crevice in the register frame. What this means is that it often violently falls on the floor, and more often than not, there are children or elderly people right where it can damage their feet or what have you. A more seemingly innocent issue with the registers is that they will periodically stop scanning/weighing items. For the longest time, I assumed that these problems were easily fixable by resetting the scanner. I had done it a dozen times up until this point, and when Kintsu's register presented the problem, I felt confident that I could fix it for him and get things running again. I confidently told him to step aside and let a professional handle it, and as I reached into the wiring of the register to unplug the scanner to reset it, I ended up touching a conduit pipe and‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>GUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>\n<p>I felt a big electric shock across the span of my arms and chest, and after at least a quarter of a second, I finally reacted to let go of the damn thing. I was very literally in shock, and I could still feel the electric disturbance in my chest near my heart üòÄ Up until that point in my life, I've had maybe 1 or 2 close calls with live wires, but this one came the fuck out of nowhere. Maybe it's my lack of electrical knowledge, but one would assume that something that has to be manhandled frequently like a register at a store wouldn't have fucking electrically charged covered wires, but not here, no sir. I took a couple of minutes to reflect on what had just happened because I needed to retrace why I had gotten shocked so bad, and then I finally realized it's most likely because someone taped wires together inside the pipe and there was contact where there shouldn't be, and because I was holding onto the metal hood with my left arm while I was poking around with my right and I set myself up for that nasty ground discharge path. I got the sweats afterward, as one naturally does with a near death experience, but at least in my case, if that had been it for me, at least I would have died satisfied, knowing that I've done what I can and what I've wanted to within my moral and financial constraints.</p>\n<p>A second, non personally near death experience but definitely a hazardous one, was the time that the AC unit in the ceiling fell in the middle of rush hour with people walking around because the people in charge of installing it didn't properly secure it before removing the supporting structure while trying to change it out. Now THAT was a shitshow, both because when it fell, it didn't fall all the way to the floor (it got held up by the tortilla shelf and a corner of the ceiling tile), and customers weren't securing their children from walking under or near it while it was very possibly hanging on by something that wasn't designed to hold 200+ pounds of equipment and could have definitely taken the final plunge to the floor. After a couple of hours of watching frantic workers try and carefully lower it to the ground and breathing possibly asbestos since the pink fluffy insulation in the ceiling hasn't been changed since the store was bought because why would it, the situation was finally put under control and thankfully no one was injured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KPRC2/videos/south-houston-police-are-searching-for-at-least-four-robbers-they-say-overpowere/973342189526937/\">Also, this happened here not super long ago</a>.</p>\n<p>Imagine the number of near death stories from all other workers that have ever had the privilege to work here might have, jeez.</p>"

I unplug my phone from the charger, turn off my PC, slap on a face mask, grab my water bottle, and hit the road for another round of involuntary social interactions. God, what a pain to get off the car and walk in through those doors.. I slap on my public figure personality, drag my feet across the parking lot, and rush to my timesheet to clock in once more. It's not even the coronavirus that has me exhausted; it's the stagnation of a bunch of shitty, albeit could be worse, circumstances and events outside of my control that got me stuck swimming in molasses to move forward with my life.</p>\n<p>Then in comes the world renown Grape Man. Holy shit, the man, the myth, the legend. This man is pure gold, and he doesn't even know it. I'm at my register contemplating my existence, and this guy comes to the register behind me, and he doesn't say hi. No. He doesn't even address the current social context, weather, nor his 99¬¢ cigarettes. The very first words that come out of his mouth today -- IN RUSSIA ü§£üòÇü§£ He obviously couldn't see because of the mask, but I was already cracking up because it's gonna be good.</p>\n<p>\"In Russia, the only place that requires face masks is McDonald's\"</p>\n<p>Never change, Grape Man, never change. Do shower though, today you were specially smelly.</p>\n<p>After having my mind cleared from that interaction, I was officially in the game -- I was warmed up and dispatching customers lightning mcfast. Sometimes, I go so fast that customers aren't ready to pay when I tell them the total. Like, they stare at me wondering why I'm telling them a number (their total). This one middle aged woman though was wayyyy in lala land though. I told her her total, and not only did she struggle to figure out that I was finished; when she realized that she had to pay, she took out a $20 bill and tried to stick it into the card reader ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ Even she realized how dumb that was, because she started laughing and laughing and honestly, it was contagious like coronavirus c;</p>\n<p>Usually, most of the time that I walk into the restroom and find some rando in there, interactions are awkward, and most of the time they walk out without washing their hands‚Ä¶ WHY WHY WHY EWW. Today though, this numnuck stoopid ass perv walked into the restroom while I was using a urinal, and stood right behind me a couple of feet right where I could see him and he could see me. I turned around and made eye contact with him and he just stood there dumbfounded‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I was so shocked that someone could be so fucking stupid and not realize how invasive they're being that I didn't tell him anything. In no scenario today did I imagine that I would have to tell a grown ass man that he shouldn't stand right behind me while I'm trying to pee, wow. When I finished, he told me to \"Go ahead\" and I was thiiiiiis close to asking him why he stood there watching me take a leak. Damn. Like, this is definitely tmi so look away now you've been warned‚Ä¶.. ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ok, so like, I'm not pee shy, which is especially helpful with the cramped ass restroom at work, but I almost felt my feed cut off from being so weirded out by the guy just standing there behind me lmao. I've said it before and I'll say it again -- these people are bots, prove me wrong ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Missed an opportunity to urinate on a grown man today. Never thought I'd tick that box off while being 100% sober.</p>\n<p>The afternoon after that fiasco was pretty standard though. Bimbo man came in and brought ants on one of his boxes and Boss Man went full üî®üî®üî®üî®üî®üî® ball buster mode on him and made me get Raid to spray on the bread to kill the ants lol And then a lady was buying hamburger supplies, and bought a pickle jar that I made the mistake of giving to a small child to carry (the child broke the jar, surprise surprise). After being showered by the pickle juice, I offered her the chance to go get another one while I cleaned up the mess, so she had her older daughter go get another jar. Then she wanted to pay with food stamps, but needed for me to type in the numbers manually since here magnetic stripe doesn't work. I don't have any issue with typing in numbers or anything like that, but I still don't know how to do that, and when I informed her of this, she told her little children that they were going to another store because \"they don't want to type in the numbers for me here\". This bitch, after all the work I went to replacing her broken pickle jar too, wowww. Maybe it's the tone of voice I said it in, but whatever.</p>\n<p>Boss Man ended the day by angrily telling some random man that had a stroke or something to go buy his dick cream and leave.</p>"

Today, the mood was \"Why are there more cashiers than carniceros right now.\" Same, Boss Man, same.</p>\n<p>So, I spend the majority of the morning and some of the midday hopping up and down the store getting pedidos ready to go (according to Pok√©mon Go, I walked 5 miles today, go figure), but today I got Mr. Luisito's order. It didn't seem so bad, just the usual weird shit he always buys like this VERY SPECIFIC BRAND OF SMOOTH PLATES OHMYGOD IF IT'S NOT THIS BRAND I WANT NOTHING, and caldo veggies. Except, that in my mind's eye, I didn't think that when the pedido said \"3 cabbage\", they meant 3 boxes of cabbage, so I just got this baldy 3 heads of cabbage and called it done. I fucking wish I was up front for this, it sounds like it would have been hilarious to watch from afar, but apparently, he made such a big god damned shitshow that his order WASN'T COMPLETE WHO THE FUCK DID THIS ORDER AHHHHH that even the taqueria ladies in the kitchen in the back were telling me about it LMAO. Jesus fuck now that's the Luisito I know. Fuck this man, but at the same time it's funny how stirred up he gets over minor details and very easily fixable problems‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. just like Boss Man.</p>\n<p>I also worked on a pedido for La Morenita; ezpz stuff and very straightforward to complete. Today, after the transaction was all said and done, it was time to load it up to their delivery man's truck, and it was just me and Chief.com to get that done. I would say that we both did about equal parts work getting it loaded in, but when their delivery guy came up to tip, he passed the money in front of Chief.com's face and said told me \"Here you go, thanks.\" UHHHHH lol I didn't want to be a dick and keep it all, so I gave Chief.com 30%, but shit man people really do be clear cut on how they perceive work gets done. Apparently, I have a very \"hard working demeanor\", but really I just think it's the light skin ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cash King came in today with half his face swollen from being in a fist fight.

As I imagined, the alarm clock this morning was just pure pain, like waking up for an 8am for college, but literally way fucking worse because it's out of necessity. And yet, somehow, there are people that see the doors open before 6am and just decide to start their day grocery shopping ü§Æ Literally not even 10 minutes into opening, a crackhead couple walked into the store. Usually, when crackheads walk in bright and early in the morning, it means that they've been out and about and are looking for a quick fix of cigarettes or beer or something before moving on. This time though, these people got themselves a cart and started shopping around. In my time working here, I've only seen a handful of people that go 30+ minutes walking about shopping comparing prices and generally just taking their sweet time getting their errand done. No one batted an eye at this couple until 30, 40, 50 minutes went by and they were still walking around the store looking through item after item. After all the red flags had been raised, Militant Man went full, well, militant mode, just letting everyone know to keep an eye out for any funny business conducted by these people. I watched from afar how they went shelf by shelf, item by item, but neither of them had large bags or deep pockets to keep anything in, so I was just completely baffled, but mostly entertained by the prospect that someone would come in and first thing in the morning sack the store, especially before 6am.</p>\n<p>After the first morning rush of people trying to get their daily fix of coffee, I decided to go sleuthing and see what the deal with them was. I swear, these two were literally just casually shopping and reading the descriptions of every single item that they came across like it was their first time going shopping for themselves. They had a really nice demeanor, and I felt bad for judging them so harshly for their very obvious substance abuse. The real life Carl and Ellie, if you will. For example, the man would say \"Hey babe, come look at this soap. It says to use in HIGH EFFICIENCY machines!\" It really was that innocent of a trip, and I felt like an asshole for the rest of the time they were there. They ended up leaving around 7:30am, so they were easily in there for at least an hour and a half -- that's gotta be a record somewhere for genuine shopping time (they definitely won't beat this one old lady that comes in and takes like 3 hours to buy like 2 bags of cookies and a couple of vegetables and milk‚Ä¶ that old lady is QUEEN at taking her sweet ass time, like not even The Men are willingly present that long in their own store lmao).</p>\n<p>My one year anniversary is coming up in 21 days, so woooo‚Ä¶.</p>"

For some reason, mamma didn't remember about her face covering until they were inside the store, so she takes out what I would assume is a face mask for herself that she had in her purse and put it on her before they got too far inside. But her face is very obviously too small, and as soon as mom put the thing on her face, it was like she took saran wrap and wrapped her entire face from forehead to chin üòÇüòÇüò≠ Normally, I'd say fuck 'em kids, but the way the little girl stumbled then when mom finally realized what she had done and I just couldn't contain myself.

What are y'all gonna drink that meat with, air?\" Sure enough, I look down and they actually forgot to get anything to drink! As soon as I thought at them, \"maybe a little bit of water would help y'all some,\" another one yelled back \"Air? Bitch it's called water.\" Fucking LOOOOOL I held back my urge to laugh, and I watched in amusement as they scrambled among themselves to figure out what to get to drink until finally the one that thought they were drinking air waddled over to the cold Cokes and heaved a couple of 12 packs \"for good measure\". They paid with Lone Star, a classic move with cartfulls of junkfood (God bless poverty and the sugar that keeps it afloat), and finally went on their merry way.</p>\n<p>This morning Militant Man has officially confirmed that the store will be opening at 5:30am. It makes sense because it's very rushed to try and get coffee done before swarms of people start walking in but fuuUuuUUuuUUuuuUUUUUuuUuuuck</p>"

He's a respectable man; he always comes with his best boots and belt, and always pulls out nice THICK wads of unordered cash to pay for his tripas, chuck roll, pastor, you name it, hence the nickname. Something about his personality or his physical features (definitely both) rub off on you as him being a hard working, but also very personable man. So this very well shaped lady walks by while he's paying me, and he knows that I know that he knows that we know that that was some fiiiiiiiine booty walking by. This man pauses his cash counting, closes his eyes, and does a little sign of the cross, and then keeps on counting cash like the fucking king that he is LOOOOOOOOL God damn, that's a level of ass admiration that I've never seen anywhere else before üëèüëèüëè I just can't believe I forgot entirely about this when I wrote my blog entry yesterday. Better late than never!</p>\n<p>Today's main superstar was gone - Kintsu you piece of shit, I love you bro, and it hurts when you're gone ;c Of all days to miss work, you chose payday you dum dum it better have been a good fucking reason. It wouldn't have been such a big deal though, if it weren't that Big Boss's daughter was also absent lmao. When we needed y'all most, you vanished! The show went on though, so mad props to QtSteel for pulling that bread through and me for knowing how to make up prices for big list items like the big genius that I am.</p>\n<p>But enough about me and my big, sexy brain (that totally doesn't make mistakes ever). Instead, let's talk about this fucking lil fatty bitch of a 10-12 year old girl that started crying because her mommy didn't buy her Cheetos Funyuns. Holy moly. I'm not a parent yet, so take my words with a pound of salt, but there's undeniably an age cutoff for when kids should stop making spectacles out in public. Lord, if that were my kid I would beat that shit out of her so fast she never knew what hit her. I'm kidding of course, but I definitely wouldn't let that kind of behavior grow out of hand. Some of the parents that come in and buy stuff for their kids really do be out there being money slaves to their every whims like try keeping that up in their teens and young adult lives see how that works out for you. My guess is those kids would end up working at a grocery store run by some middle eastern middle aged men that have an authoritarian grasp over every aspect of how the store operates, to the point where they would remind you about an item you undercharged for two days because It'S iMpOrTaNt FoR mAiNtAiNiNg ThE pRoFiT mArGin. Bruh, a single (key word here SINGLE, as in 1 time) 60¬¢ loss on an item ain't gonna ruin the store, buddy. Still kinda salty about that one üò§üò§üò§</p>\n<p>ANYWAY, Big Boss almost hit this dude with his truck. What a Big Boss thing for him to do ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Poor guy was mad at him, and for good reason, but good luck fighting the man that controls the entire suburb. He got the police department eating out of the palm of his hand BOY. This guy went to school with QtSteel, so she knows his name and personal details, but what she doesn't know that I know about him is where he lives (saw him walking out of his house on a trip to find stolen carts for Boss Man), and that he asked for Eevee's whereabouts one time around Thanksgiving/Christmas.</p>\n<p>üåàthe more you knowüåàüåü</p>"

The paletero brought her a mangonada specially for her, and she had left it in the cooler all day to take. She was fixing to walk away, and she tells me \"Hopefully the paletero didn't put any love potion in it cuz it ain't gonna work on me\". For some reason, I found that hilarious and random as fuck, so I played along and asked her \"Why, he's a good working man and full of nothing but sweetness\" and she responded \"Well, it's for my son, so if anyone's gonna be falling for him it's gonna be him\". Anyway, that was hilarious. To think that she was at one point my least favorite coworker too.

He came to my register to pay for a 7-UP and some Funyuns, a classic move when he's got the munchies on the triple. I don't judge. In fact, I feel bad for him because I know just how badly he wants to stop being overweight. But anyways, I had noticed a little disposible tray in the register behind me, and usually that area is reserved for the managers when they're snacking. I didn't think much of it, until I had nothing going on for a brief couple of minutes. I opened up the container and found a fork and a few cactus bits in there. This man gave up eating the cactuses and got himself those Funyuns lmaooo Fucking same. Well, that, or he tried to cancel out his sinful food with some healthy stuff. Either way, it sucks that healthy food just doesn't taste that great, but what can I say other than the struggle is real.</p>"

Good for the store, bad for the back (I definitely strained my disks today, yikes‚Ä¶.). This morning came in this pretty little princess of a man and his hog of a wife. Nothing out of the ordinary, except for the fact that my man wasn't \"attended like he should be\" and without him and his tiny purchase we don't get to get paid -_-. All of this at 6:30 in the fucking am just because my coworker didn't go out of her way to find another pack of coffee cups just for him since the ones he was forcing out of the cup holder kept ripping (this ding dong didn't realize that you can also get the cups from behind where they don't get damaged). Personally, I would have gotten him and his mistress their cups for coffee since it's whatever, but the man literally stayed quiet when I asked him how I could help and instead chose to keep on ranting and ranting and ranting. Jesus fuck, these people are literally bots -- prove me wrong. I accidentally made my coworker laugh for dismissing him as a lost case before he was out of earshot, and he turned around and yelled \"Go ahead and laugh at me, you clowns\". looool Outside the daily 1 or 2 frisky clients that want to make a giant fucking scandal out of the tiniest issues, everything seemed to be going about as smoothly as it could.</p>\n<p>Then came in this omega asshole. This motherfucker, Luisito, is an old, bald, arrogant, demanding, narcissistic sleaze, and every time he's in the store, everybody's cortisol level rises. Normally, I don't mind him doing his thing, but today Mr. Luisito decided it would be a good idea to not only interrupt me while I was trying to handle 3 different tasks at the same, but to do so while coming from behind me and snatching the pen I was using right out of my hand. THIS BITCH OOHHHHMAHHGAWD I fucking lost it. Normally, I'm a gentle giant, but today I went corporate on his ass. I snatched that pen right out of his hand and I told him straight up that if he wants something he has to wait his god damned turn. I don't know if I overdid it (according to my coworker, she'd never seen me be that visibly angry before), or if apart from all those adjectives I used to describe him he's also a lil bitch (probably definitely, yes), but boyyyyy this man changed his tune so quick. He started yes manning me for the remainder of the time he was in the store, and behaved pretty nicely after that. Man, my blood still boils thinking about this man, ugh SUBJECT CHANGE!</p>\n<p>Ok, so funny moment flashback. This didn't happen today, it actually happened a few weeks ago, but it's worth mentioning here. Imagine it's March 20, 2020; the coronavirus pandemic is just barely a week old, and grocery stores have been sacked down to the offbrands of the offbrands. This hardy fucking store pulled through (BIG big props to our managers for working through that, I genuinely hope they've recovered from those tumultuous couple of weeks), but recovery wasn't obvious at the time. Now, imagine for a second that you're a dummy idiot and believe that the world's toilet paper supply would never recover from the scare, so you bought the giant $45 rolls that Mexico Lindo had (and still has) available. I would imagine you'd be livid to find out that the good brands of toilet paper slowly came back into circulation 3 weeks later, and now you're stuck with at least a year's worth of shitty toilet paper lmaoo.</p>\n<p>Well, this one Karen thought it would be a great idea to come back with one of those rolls and demand a refund for one of those giant packs. BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH There was a limit at the time of 1 of the little packs inside the giant pack at the time, and the managers HAD to have made a personal exception for her to buy the giant roll. That was the easiest professional \"fuck off\"'s I've ever seen been dealt to someone, and despite her persistence, our manager didn't yield and she left with her giant pack in shame. I swear, I expect the worst from people, and I'm somehow still surprised at how low and shameless some people are willing to go to have their way. The vibe in the air after she left defeated was cathartic; call it a post-nut clarity if you will.</p>\n<p>Finally, the basket holder's back in the tripping spot again yaaaay‚Ä¶ We still got 2 baskets in this ho so fuck 'em up fam.</p>"

To Chief.com's credit, he DID make a valuable contribution today: he made me figure out how many minutes there are in October lmaoo.

He got his dinner of two 6 packs of cheap beer, but he surprisingly didn't ask for 99¬¢ cigs. Instead, he walked up to my register and said he was sorry for what he said last time -- that he didn't mean the things he said about Big Boss's daughter. Honestly, I didn't know what the hell he was talking about for about 3 sentences, until he mentioned that he was just \"blowing smoke up her ass\". LMAOOO Well, that's a sentence I never expected to hear from Grape Man, not because it's original or out of context. He's just usually not that cool about social situations; usually he's balls deep about some deep state conspiracy theory he saw on the YouTubes. Grape Man, if you have somehow through your own wit stumbled on this post, you're a beautiful human being in your own way, take a shower more often (I don't have the cojones to tell you in person), and what you got going on is, quite literally, something worth studying in depth. They say keep Austin weird, and you singlehandedly keep Texas weird my guy ;)</p>\n<p>Today a group of 3 musketeers showed up to buy a 24 pack of beer -- the over 21 guy, the money guy, and the wingman. Nothing seemed to be going out of the ordinary, until it was time to pay. I asked for ID, and after over 21 guy showed his 1996 birthday or wuteva, money guy pulled out a gift debit card. He does the card payment procedure, hears the beep, and then stares visibly confused at the screen. He knows the transaction didn't go through, and I tell him the card only paid for $6. I shit you not, this motherfucker starts going all Zach Galifianakis math meme on me, and then he starts laughing. He tells his bros his bitch of a girlfriend owes him $24 cuz he knew that hoe had money in it before he got it today. BRUHHHHHHHH I've only ever seen that kind of shortage analysis from Boss Man, but this dum-knuck lookin ass out here figuring out why he's short and laughing about it with the bros had me all kinds of laughing like wow, what a bitch to take your money bro :P He ended up paying with cash, but when the little receipt came up with the big bold $6 he paid, he was like \"Yeah, lemme show her that\" and he fucking took the little paper too. I was fucking dead after that I swear.</p>\n<p>The year is 20XX. Coronavirus has killed 99% of boomers, and Mexico Lindo still hasn't obtained handheld baskets. +1 to my bro Kintsu for moving the goD dammned basket holder to where it doesn't trip people &lt;3.</p>\n<p>What a fucken day.</p>"

Today he came in and bought his usual 1-2 of beer and 99¬¢ cigarettes, and kept his tinfoil hat commentary to a minimum, but the funniest bit today for him was his commentary on me and the Big Boss's daughter. She made the usual play where she pretends to be related to me, and he fell just like everybody else, but what he did different is that he started making an in-depth analysis about our different power levels of work. According to him, she is 15% more potent than me at the job. Good shit, Grape man, good shit‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Personally for me, the highlight of the day was making an Excel template for the smaller sheets of stickers that we have available for price tags. I got to chill by the computer and burn close to an hour working with that, so that was nice. I probably burned through 30 sheets of paper to get it just right, but it's for science so fuck 'em up fam. What I really wish is that I could dedicate my full time to working on item pricing, and creating a more streamlined way of handling the ever-changing prices on items all around the store. However, there's other priorities right now, like telling one of your bigger regular clients to fuck off (good job with that one, Big Boss). Granted, I did hear him telling his daughter that the client had lied and was definitely in the wrong, so assuming that's the case, it's refreshing to see that bickering doesn't always work for clients. It's defintely off-putting to get stuck in the middle of those discussions though, but what can I say other than it's what makes the ins and outs of the day that much more interesting.</p>\n<p>Finally, today officially marks another day without new handheld baskets. I tried to move the basket container once again to a spot where it won't trip people over. Hopefully with the new placement, the morning shift people will leave it be and it will inspire management to give these baskets a bit more priority‚Ä¶.. pfffffft LOL.</p>\n<p>That's all folks!</p>"

Maybe someone will finally realize that the basket holder that trips everyone over should be taken out before someone gets injured, but I actually predict that people will just keep asking for baskets until one day our only choice will be to tell them that this place doesn't have handheld baskets, and that they should have thought about how stupid they must feel for asking before daring to ask for a small and reasonable accomodation from our overlords‚Ä¶. errr.. managers (if you're reading this and you're a manager at Mexico Lindo, much love and praise and respec &lt;3).</p>"
